"17:09 
Most Icononic Celebration of Cricket History !!!❤🎉"
Australia lost the test at 351/9 and wasted that review
I thought we were toast when Broad was out!
aus ☕️☕️
"ENGLAND-🗿
AUSTRALIA-🤡"
What a test match🎉🎉
Luck with stokes
Cricket is usually boring but this was just pure cinema
"Who thinks Stokes was out? I'm not sure myself but excellent commentary and well done Australia, they were brilliant. Australia gifted us this test."
Wow 😲
❤❤❤❤
"The Aussies 'won it' twice in any other circumstances. A daft/wasted final review, a gimme stumping and an incorrect umpire call with no reviews. Theatre."
"Australia 🦘 vs england no no no.
Australia vs Ben stoke yes yes yes."
"That clear lbw when there was two runs to win....
This is how it works for England.Good innings Uncle Ben"
This Day No For Aussie . One Runout One LBW Two Catches. Everything Happened In This Match 😂😂
"It was an lbw actually but apart from all that a historic inning played by a remarkable all-rounder world has ever seen ""Ben Stokes"""
Eng kiynne thanikarama pissuwak eh crowd eka❤️🫶🏼17:08

"I an watching highlight again , and still this is the best inning in all formats ."

"I saw this match live, I fel so sad when they lost the review and there were no review left when lyon bowled stokes. That was England's day"
Reel dekh kar kon kon aya hai

Umpire ne baimani khilyaya hai stokes out tha englend cricket baiman desh hai

Legendary innings ❤

Last over umpiring sucks
Everytime's luck with England 👀🏏🥶
Who watch in 2024 after watching reels 😉
♥️🇮🇳♥️
Best test innings
"That cummin over where they took the review, was the game over😂"
Bad Luck Australia Huge Missed Runout Leon 🙈
at the end the umpire saves the match. BTW the greatest innings of all time. Ben you beauty.
Outstanding stokes
Fix match because  catch dropped reason
Totally fix match
Australia be like we hate cricket
I say the ben stock are the most luck person in our planet 😊😊😊😊
"Real winner is aus. Dat lbw.. was clearly out,,, match was fixed.."
I hope they are able to bring the same level of performance as recent home test.
Lefties when it comes to clutch 💀♾️
Greatest match of all time 😨
It's not your first time watching this incredible cricket
Ben Stokesy ❤
Kusal perera s🗿🗿🗿🗿inngins
Burning a review even when you know the ball is missing stumps is the BIGGEST BLUNDER for aus cricket
CROUD 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍😍😍
Man of the Match: Joel Wilson
Start from 9.40
What a match
One of the best innings 🔥
The greatest 1 run in history goes to Jack Leach😅
Who was the commentator?
Bad umpiring in last wicket it is suck umpiring
who is watching in November 2o24
❤
Greatest inning in a test history by ben stocks❤❤
Umpire and god was with england
Here is only one is hero and that one is JOE WILSON THE UMPIRE WHO DENIED THE LBW IN THE LAST 😂
"“If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’”"
This proves even Australian players will buckle under pressure.
"Australia had two chances to win this ashes but they missed that , once when Warner dropped stockes catch at boundary and another when lyon missed that run out of leach and then the history was created 🎉"
"Whenever I watch this highlight it gives goosebumps, specially that scene when stockes scored boundary raise his hand in the air n audiences in the stand get up n cheers at the same time 🙌"
Ben stoke ne pak k khilaf Kuch nhi Kiya 😂
The greatest test innings...
What a player Mr. BEN STOKES.
Imagine being the main character of the greatest Test and ODI match ever played
Fix 🙄
14:53  Oh!!! Joe Wilson!!
Ben stokes ne ma chhod Dali Australia walo ki
The umpire is the real winner here
While watching 📉📈📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📉📈📈
Incredible
Best Ashes ever...
I watched it live too in 2019! What a memorable Test! 👍 👌   ❤️ 🏏 😊
"Cricket surely teaches about life 
Don't give up till the end 
Small mistakes can make you loose big things 
Don't celebrate too early"
Suspense thriller movie ❤
Legends in 2024
Anyone will say that best test match ever
6:33 what he said????
2nd best innings of all time in test first was inning by kusal prera against sa in sa
Ben stokes greatest all rounder
What about naython lyon's wicket?
"Greatest inning in each format:-

Stokes in Test against Aus🔥🔥🔥

Maxwell in Odis against Afghanistan 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Kohli  in T20is vs PAK 🔥 🔥🔥🔥"
This match give the lesson luck favours the brave. How England and Stoke survived in last phase omg👁️👄👁️
Imagine if the match would have got tied.
I feel sorry for the aussies 🙂they missed a thousand opportunities
"14:34 Behind every successful inning or good match, there's often an unsung hero – the umpire."
"I never forget these three matches that I watch live :- Ben stokes(headingely), India 2021 lords , 2021 ind vs aus in gabba ❤❤❤❤❤❤"
That umpire did it for England. Assshole.
13:58 the goosebumps ❤

Real hero was umpire and Lyon
"Ben stokes is goat because he plays

•an amzaing innings in ODI final
•a greatest innigns in ashes final
•a greatest innings in t20 wc final"
"14:55 The Luck!!!
he is out but aus doesn't have a review left"
🔥🔥
this game was scripted by God😂
Still there is no comparison btw eng nd aus test cricket in aus home ground aus clean sweep them and in england home ground they manage to win or draw
Hard work paid🥶
We all know that was out but still 💀🗿
Goosebumps 🎉🎉🎉
I am from india and i want to become a cricketer in Australia or england cricket team

Good point. Australia not only the test world champions but the one day as well. Massive deterioration. 😂
What a inning  😮
17:08 that is cold as fu**
In my opinion and I’m not even a huge cricket fan but I think this day is one of the best sporting moments in any sport in the history of sport.
"Undoubtedly, innings of two left hand batsman rocked the Aussies - Rishabh Pant and Ben Stokes"
🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🤝🤝🤝🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Luck was with england❤
17:04 absolute cinema
What a crowd!
Good father of this match
The greatest 1 not out of all time.
"Chance 1 : 4:02
Chance 2 : 9:32
Chance 3 : 10:02
Chance 4 : 12:07
Chance 5 : 13:05
Chance 6 : 13:36
Chance 7 : 13:55

Australia literally missed 7 chances of getting ben stokes , leach and england back to the pavilion . 🤣🤣"
"Ben stokes effect: even mighty aussies will do misfielding. 
When he show fear on the opponent eyes"
Charlene Orchard
Wow only life is true understand it first
"Joel Wilson, the blind umpire from Trinidad & Tobago is the man of the match for England after gifting them the win"
"Had australian didn't took review of Jake leach, they would have won by 1 run since Ben stokes was out.😅"
LEACH 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Well, heroics come once in a while. Stokes can't be appreciated more. But, It's Aussies who gave away the match. First Paine burnt the review when ball pitched way outside leg and even Pat indicated that. Second, Garry couldn't collect the throw for an easy run out. Was it Ben overwhelming pressure?"
One of the best test match thrill❤❤
❤❤❤❤beni
Absolute cinema❤
Ben stokes 🐐
"At 12:08
This is a proof, You just need to be brave enough. 
God will take care of the rest. The cosmic power will help you."

at 6:33 some one said pakar that is hindi or urdu word pakistani and indians can relate but how beacause both teams are english speaking can any one tell me
💯 time watched by Patrick James Cummins😂
I watch ashes just bcoz. of the crowd support
Stokes is the luckiest player in the cricket history
one of the greatest test match in history of cricket
.
Now imagine Bumrah or Chahal in Leach's position😂...
Who are 2024
King Curve
"To have teeth, teeth should be given dignity. If Australia hadn't spoiled the review, they would have won 🙃"
Marian Valley
"3 drop catches of stokes
An easy run out miss of leach 
Wrong decision by umpire with all 3 reds 

Luckiest win ever I must say."
so stokes was actually out LBW but saved by a bent ump - just like edgbaston in 2005 when kasprowicz's hand was not on the bat and 1981 Headingley when the aussies backed themselves to lose - there is a nasty taste in the mouth
Verdie Dam
All 5world trophies are apart and This match is another part ..Benstokes name forever be remembered in Australian guys😂
What a player stoke.... I really enjoyed the poll shot of the stoke
"What a match!!
What a innings by Stokes!!
Best Test Of History!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉"
Umpire favoured the England team clearly seen😢
I really hope rachin can also do the same nz vs sl 🤞
TOO MUCH LUCK FAVOURED HIM. STILL GREAT NOCK

That was classss!!!!!!!!
17:07 the cameraman deserves an Oscar for capturing this iconic moment!!!!❤🙌🏻🔥💫

"17:11, that shot though"
"But it was out on LBW , very poor decision by umpire"
Stokes to every player just stay there
Morar Ramp
"Two reason Australia there losing match.Nathan miss run-out.umpire call not out..
Clear Lbw! But this is part of the match..but Stokes Hero anytime England side..."
Review hota toh match australia ka tha aus ne ek review waste kiya bina mtlb ka jb jaruri tha tha bcha nhi
A+ on this test . Good score on the report card 😁
"Love from Sri Lanka🇱🇰 to this great player
Ben Stokes👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾"
"If Cummins didn't take review out of desperation than stokes was out on Nathan lion's ball, a wrong decision taken out of desperation always hurts, if MS would have been there, he would never take review, he would have kept that review for 8 runs and used when required but Australia deserves every bit of that lost😂"
Greater one of all time 😂
"Maxwell innings against afganistan is way way better than this, but this innings will be on  2nd❤❤❤❤"
Such matches are the reason why I can’t undo my love for test cricket ❤
13:55 that is too much to
Wasted review last moment not out a run out miss too many hard chances missed . Thats australias fault that they lost it
"Ben stokes against India🤡
Ben stokes against Australia☠️🥵👽"
Mahaan Khiladi Mahaan Jeet
Who is watching in 2024
I just watched the 4 sixes given by Ben Stokes in 2016 world cup and the next video was this. His journey is inspiring ❤
Imagine not liking cricket?
"""Ben stokes remember the name """
"Suppose Tim Paine didn't take review of Leach, then at last, they can take review and stokes was out and could win the match."
Stokes helped up big time by the umpire ; that LBW was plumb
"Very Bad umpaar 
Last Time 😀"
Always watch England playing to remember that cricket is a Gentleman's game
9:48 is absolutely god level
Goosebumps ❤️‍🔥
"Ben is freak but You need luck along with your skills to succeed and stokes is a one of most luckiest guy in cricket...
He was dropped two three times,than that run out,wrong lbw call,waste drs...
Otherwise it was just a fine effort in loosing cause!!!"
I'm amazed that The Sandpaper Gang didn't think to bowl underarm. Like they've done before.
Joe Wilson with the man of the match 😅
Amazing 👏 🙀 😯 😮 😲 👏 Ben stoker 🙌 👍 congratulations 🎊 👏 💐 🥳 😀 😋 history 😋 😀 match
Beauty of cricket 🏏 👌 ❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊

Bad luck for Australia no review 😢
When Cricket at its peak...and stocky the lone king sitting on the peak...

The real cinema 📽️
17:10 perfect picture of the cricket history
If 1 review left then Australia wil win the ashes
I never seen at this type of fight at end my favourite team eng ❤
"Stokes was LBW, but Australia had no review left. That doesn't mean that Stokes was not out. Such ridiculous rules. If you have the technology, why not use it everytime for accurate decision making? Australia 🦘 was the winner 🏆"
Who are in 2024??
16:59 CINEMA OF CRICKET

Greatest Test match innings I’ve ever witnessed
Aussie khatam😢
Chkoli and Zimbu dream innings
17:10 Probably one of the most iconic moments in sport.
what a match!!!❤❤❤
"I'm a bit confused with the Butler run out, Nathon Lyon didn't actually have the ball in his hands when he broke the stumps, is it just me or can somebody explain"
As a kiwi I was gutted after the CWC final - but no way of feeling anything but admiration for Ben Stokes after this epic knock.
No one can beat India in test series
fine i'll rewatch this for the 1000th time
13:59 😮😮😮😮
He didn't celebrate his century because victory is more important than century 🎉🎉❤
"This and 2005 ashes , kevin peterson and stroksyy ❤, we indians love thriller 😂"

What A Game
😮😮 incredible ben stokes lovely test match 🤗
The best movie i have ever watched
This test match greatest of all time
That’s why i love test cricket
14:35 that was out
That review for leach is where they done a blunder.
You still can’t believe that this happened. It was an impossible win. Every 4 every 6 was the equivalent of a wonder goal scored in a World Cup knock out game. There’s no better crowd than an English one in moments like that.
On this day 2019
17:06 Goosebumps.. No one can make better highlights than England and Wales Cricket 👌
Best all rounder Jadeja and stoke 😍
"This game of ben stokes will be remembered all life ❤❤❤❤
Don't know how many times I have watched this 😅😅
Different level of game 
Perfection from Ben stokes"
aus face the decisions of wrong captain
"It was a gift from Australia
So many dropped catches made stoke hero"
"My all time favourite cricketer's 

God of cricket Sachin,
Ben stokes,
Jasprit Bumrah."
17:09 instant goosebumps ❤
Best test match ever I see.
One of the greatest test match I have ever seen

"One man army

Australia missed manny opportunity
Clutch god

Why you come here again and again 😂😂😂
The only player who turned test match into t20 match
Bold descion by the umpire
"Boring are not only with HIGHLIGHTS
Who Agree😂?"
Nice ❤❤❤❤
Paine receiving intense pain from stokes 😂😂😂
Great test natch ever
"2 mistakes by Aus, * Lyon missed runout, *Cummins and Paine review 😅"
"Those who think that Stokes is legend because of this knock…It’s true but Stokes also scored a 100 on a pitch like a landmine at WACA against the rampaging Australians in 2013 Ashes which was his debut series

Perth is one of the toughest grounds to score runs 
Now this is reason why Virat Kohli is rated highly…"
Ohh ben wat r u doing to this Cricket Match
2019. It was all there for Ben Stokes to produce magic.
Me who comes every month to see this legendary innings ❤
Coldest moments of cricket history🗿💥🤌
First time i saw aussies are choked 😮
"16:37 , HEHEHE!"
Stokes literally shouts
Every test match Woakes looks different
Indians attendance hear👉
This is the beauty of test cricket ❤
Incredible innings...not taking any credit from stokes but Australia lost this match only because of cheapish captaincy and wicketkeeping of Tim paine....How did he take review only in emotion when ball was pitched outside leg
"One played by lara and the other one by stokes, great innings"
Unreal
Anyone in 2024
Ben stokes >>> kholi
Joe Wilsons bad decision Patty's worst review  Nathan Lyons missed chance everything is justifiable but 11 40 I can't understand how has that ball gone over the ropes😮. It's just not possible
What a fabulous commentator 'mark nicholas' ❤
We are all here for 17:00
The day when Stokes showed his power
That was a clear LBW at the end when only 2 runs were required. It was a very bad decision by the umpire which cost Australia an Ashes trophy😢
😢
6:33 pakad 🤔
One and the only great match

9:56 The shot tolds to aussies I can't spare you
அந்த ரிவ்யூ எடுத்திருக்கலாம் 😂❤
I Think Australia Win this match but His Fate isn't good this day
Greatest Match in the history of test cricket🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
The credit also goes to lyon for miss the easy run out & also this umpire 😅
"Best test innings ever
Ben stokes ❌️  ❌️  ❌️ 
Kusal perera ✅️ ✅️ ✅️"
Australia did a huge mistake by taking that unnecessary review
"Whenever there is a obstacles in life, believe like this, do your work, surely god will help you.."
"it's not a match, it's a proper cinematic anticlimax movie on youtube. everything is a perfection in it's own."
How would you describe that one run from Jack Leach.
One of the greatest match ever
Australian asshole 😅

2016  T20 world cup last over... birth of Ben fire stokes

As an Australian first time re watching this since it was played live 5 years ago and doesn’t get easier. Best innings in the history of test cricket hats off stokes🫡
"not hating or anything, but that lbw though..."
9:24 which shot is this
"I don't know why people call this ""boring""."
One of the greatest ever test innings played by any player

God was with england thats it!!!
Ben Stokes 🤫😎
Just a bad day for aussies!....'coz they lost their review earlier on jack leach which was a clear not out as the ball was pitching outside leg .....this review could be later used when ben stokes was actually lbw by nathan lyon......that wrong decision of taking review lost the match for australia
Wow amazing❤
17:08 goosebumps 🔥🔥🧨🎆
One of th best test match i ever watched live
"The emotions of both team
Love that❤️"
This is called the purest form of cricket; it must be preserved at any cost.
13:21 he will regret for it 😅😅😅😅😅
The great ashes
Starc kidhar tha us din starc😅
Jack Leach's 1 (17) will be etched in my memory for eternity ❤
The match was fixed
"Where luck meets talent, you fimd ben stokes there😂😅"
Stokes in 2019🗿🗿💀💀
wommala 🔥
Unavailable ❤❤❤❤
One bad decision 😢
They took the review and lost the match....could have helped them against stokes...😅😅😅😅worst was the missed run out chance 😢
What a match
"I’m not a huge cricket fan BUT … cricket commentary is on another level, they capture the feel and the moment better than any other sport!!"
The cameraman goes to award 🫡🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Perfect belt treatment for entire australian cricket team 🥶
Some one in 2024 give attendance 😂
"This match and Stokes's innings was one for the ages. Best part was when he gets to his 100. He never raises his bat cause he was determined to win the match. 100 meant nothing to him. And boy oh boy, did he put the mighty Aussies under pressure. You could see they were desperate when they took that obvious review. But as they say, fortune favors the brave, that short catch, that last six, that missed runout and that lost review. Fortune favored Stokes who was fearless and on a mission"
2016 t20 final to this inning ❤️‍🩹stokes proved himself
I Feel sorry for those who didn't witness this one of the best innings in test cricket
Luck favored for England
Australia miss Chances 😢
Trivia -- ben stokes scored his maiden half century in the final of the t20 worldcup😮...against pakistan...

Cheaters
17:07 ohhh wow
Unbelievable match
"I watched this match live, now am watching England vs Namibia but  I am missing Stokes, so I came to watch it
3:52 am"
Unfair for Aussies 💔
2019 everything went in favour of England be it umpire's decision or in world cup final
Still watching absolutely brilliant

Bro jos buttler is not out
Me
I come again
Legendary Crowd ❤
An absolute thriller. Ben Stokes and Jack Leach played their best innings.
17:04
Can't get over the fact that they wasted their review out of desperation on that one that pitched 6 inches outside leg.
1vs11
if Aus  didn't waste a reveiw on that lbw then the could won by 1 run
"Greatest Individual knock,
In Test: Stokes's 135 vs AUS (2019 Ashes)
In ODI: Maxwell's 201 vs AFG (2023 WC)
In T20I: Kohli's 82 vs PAK (2022 T20 WC)
Isn't it?😍🔥"
"India vs Pakistan 🤡🤡
Ashes🗿🗿🗿"
❤❤❤
Something about a Test at Yorkshire.
Great game. An ultimately unsuccessful series for England though.
Ben stokes kya khelta h
watched this live ❤️
THE BEST
"Australia really screwed this up. Missed a catch, an easy run out and a DRS review. The umpire also screwed up that decision."
Talent and luck combined
Headingly really is a special place when its on it.
"The moment when Ben Stokes lifted his hand immediately after winning the match , probably the greatest moment of ASHES as well as cricket's history.(17.05)"
17:00 🔥
Haters say it is umpire's mistake 😂😂😂
"IPL kids- test cricket is boring
The test cricket- 
(Includes headingley and gabba)"
"Ben Stokes & Rishabh Pant…
Greatest Test Innings ever….🎉"
"Ben Stokes….!
What an innings….!!!!"
fixed mattch
"As an old school cricket fan ,it is important to attend this innings.Once in a while cheers to Ben Stokes"
One of the greatest test match innings. Love u Stokes for this innings ❤❤

Australia Deserved the win
Catches win matches
When there is luck.  No one can steal the moment from you
"he is real hero, Love from Bangladesh"
"TEST Matches are the best ,,, I don't care if anyone say's who's got time to see 5 day's match... than don't watch any cricket if you can't appreciate it's purest and best format.. Go watch some baseball instead... it test's the players... if they are just fluke or the real talent.. if they got the temperament if they got the determination.... I will always rate test above ODI any day... I don't count t20... that is just for entertainment... which is also necessary..."
Whenever you got depressed 🫥 come and watch this test match
I watched it thousands time but it still gives us goosebumps
The best test inning of test cricket
Hitting sixes with 1 wicket left and there is India in wc final after few wickets afraid to hitting in final
Whenever low in life..Watch this inning and get the energy !
17:08 This is absolute cinema!!!
Test match boring?
"After this, nobody ever doubted ben stokes ever again"
MoM: Joel Wilson
"""Has he dropped the ashes?"" sounds frightening when out of context."
"Everything was just perfect when needed
That sixes just above fielders heads 
Those close catches dropped 
That unnecessary review
That not out by umpire
That run out drop by Lyon 
Just as perfect as possible"
It is said that luck also favors the brave.
Bro Pause Aus !!
Greatest test match ever❤
"Who all watched the winning shot and shouted ""BEN STOKES"" in Virat Kohli style🔥🔥🔥"

"One of the greatest test match,if not the greatest test match."
17:00
"Wow,,,,,,,,"
If aus captain would haven’t taken the review early then it could be a match for Australia
Crowd standing ovation for every ball played by leach was terrific
This is one of the best individual sporting moments of all time.
Stokes genius
I feel sorry for IPL kids who think T20 is the best form of cricket
Anyone watching in 2024?
He is dropped the ashes😮
17.5 Goosebumps 🥶🔥
We demand a full coverage of the final day!
Lucky ❤
What A Bad Luck Australia
you don't often get to say this but aussies choked this time. wasted review that clearly was not out resulting in no reviews left when stokes was out but not given by the umpire. missed run out chance of leach.
The most insane cricketing story.
I am watching this again. And I ask everyone!! Honestly!! Is there any test match better than this one???? This thrilling???
This type of player are born in century ❤amazing innings🥳
1 man Army Ben Stokes ❤
Those 17 crucial balls for leach was horrible for him. A clueless innings by Ben stokes....
"Ben stokes didn't celebrate 50 nor 100, shows winning the match was important for him Greatest all-rounder of morden cricket ♥"
"How all of that can happen for Australia, catch drops, missed a easy runout and umpire didnt gave a lbw"
"Top 2 moments for me in test
1. This one... Lovely comeback
2. TOOTA HAI GABBA KA GHAMAND/ FOTRESS GABBA HAS BEEN BREACHED"
Ben stokes
0:50 ben stokes:we are gonna see later🗣️
He is not celebrated his 100 but after win his celebration is special always special...
No one in the current era can bat better with tailenders than Ben Stokes 🔥
that's why virat named him so much
"What a Thrilling Match.....
When a run out misses it wat really goosebumps💥💥😘
Well played England"
I was in 12th that time and we're seeing this match from coaching in our friends mobile and when stokes hit that four we just jumped in joy like we won the ashes that was a great moment ❤ well played stoksey 💪

One of the best test match
16:58 the moment 🔥
Ben stokes the clutch player
"Heroes come and go but
Legends are for Ever. 
-Kobe Bryant-"
Possibly the greatest sporting moment in English history. Brings a tear to my eye every time
No Mitchell Starc and pay cummins was in a bad form too
"this is real cricket, the gentle man’s game."
Match of the century.
14:16 yes he dropped..!
Feel for ban stroke and butller
Stokes would have murdered leach if he got ran out then
I still get nervous watching this even though I know he survives and does it
Greatest test innings ever
The sound of stadium 🏟️ 🔥🔥
Roared like a lion
"Best test inning 
1) stokes vs Australia in 2019 
1) pant vs Australia in gabba

Best odi innings 
1) Maxwell vs Afghanistan in WC

Best T20 innings 
Virat kohli vs Pakistan in T20 WC"
there were two chances for Australia...1. the run out 2. If they had not wasted DRS earlier when the ball was clearly down the leg side. But Stokes inning was just phenomenal.
benstoke confidence
17:05 Love that Moment
What a match ❤ greatest
Reaction of Australian fans 16:37
that knowingl review of outside leg. who knows that the review could be used in 8 runs spare
Who is here in 2024
Anyone watching this highlights in 2024 ?

Celebrating Not After Own Century ...  But After Team Wins ..... Really Splendid Way To Celebrate the Marvelous Moment 👏👏👏
"From 17:00 to 17:20

This is the best test innings ❤❤
17:04

Cricket means Test cricket.
Bad catching skill of nathan lyon was a huge cause for lose  of australia
Australia deserves win 😢😢😢😢
A
कितनी बार भी देखो मन ही नही भरता
17:08
First Nathan Lyon and secondly the Umpire Joe Wilson gave England the lifeline
Sometimes or rare sight that the mighty aussies will also choke
Most entertaining match by Ben stokes inning👍
"Legend Ben Stokes. The passion, bravery and might of a true warrior."
Bad Luck Australia
Hacker hai bhai hacker 💀💀🌞
"Ashes :Soul of cricket

Virat Kohli favourite Ben stokes
Phenomenal cricket. At its finest. Goosebumps every time I watch.
"Tears in my eyes, what a player jack and ben❤️❤️❤️"

UMPIRE BIKA HOYA H OUT THA BEN STOKES
13:55 Leach must have been so relieved here 😭
Best test match ever
Greatest test Innings of all time❤
🎉🎉
Who loves indian army comment❤❤❤
15:02 the greatest one
There is nothing more entertaining than the last day of a test match
"I live in England and I remember when my friend told me in school that England is 9 down but Stokes is still playing and I got flashbacks of the WC final 2019 and got so excited that I ran home after school and when I reached, England still needed around 35-40 runs and then those vibes while watching the match were just different and unmatched. That day was peak cricket and peak enjoyment for me."
Every true cricketer fan know the value of this innings 🤞🏻 Bow down to Ben Stokes 🙌🏻💯
"Many people are saying that this is the best cricket. True, altough I am an australian fan, this is one of the best moment of the cricket. However, many people didn't see the other things that australia also played well. This is what make me fall in love with australia,"" if u want to beat me, then u have to play better than me and that play will become the best moment of history."""
"The clip from 17:00 to 17:15, idk how many times I’ve watched it. Who’s the cameraman? James cameron or what 😅"
രോമാഞ്ചം 🔥🔥
2:23 transition we witnessed
Visit whenever you need a dose of motivation ❤
Iok
13:44 That monstrous look🔥
Stokes my favourite player
ben stokes did a 1vs11 clutch
This is Cinema
2:03 funniest part😅😅
Imagine thinking cricket is boring
IPL never reached these levels
"Ben fucking Stokes, that's right bitches, greatest man to have picked up the sport of croquet"
Goosebumps ❤
"Whenever I want to watch greatest match of cricket, I do come here."
Saw a test with T20 fielding setup
16:59 iconic side view with crowds 😮😮
Def the worst day for australia
That's why I always says  Test cricket is the best form of Cricket
Fielding is biggest part of the match😮❤
too many mistakes made by aus team particularly leach run-out chance missed by lyon
we r sorry ben stokes...indian pitches r different🙃
"Big match , Big player:- What! a man Ben stokes you beauty. 😮😮😮"
Test is the best format of cricket I think
The best Ashes match ever
Moral of the story... Take your DRS' decisions wisely :D
Stokes is one man army 😅😅😅
this reminds me laxman and ohja did the same way in india vs aus why its always with australia only haha
King Kohli
Australia deserved this win but ben stokes got lucky 1 runout 1 catch 1 lbw if even one of that balls result was different than Australia would have won and yeah Australia wasted their review on ben stokes before
Ben stokes one men army❤️❤️
Stokes the luckiest cricketer ever
Is there any particular word exist to describe this innings I mean iconic and the greatest and wht more to sayy?🔥🥵🤯🥶hattsoff mannn!🙌🏻
"Listen to the sound of the crowd.
wow
EPIC ! 😍"
Best ever innings by stokes in test
"Btw it was Australia's win first they lost the review at the wrong time 
Second they didn't have the review at the right time."
Review was the game changer for aus at the end
Out tha Australia reivew is 0
Nathan Lyon can cheat...
Super benstokes 🎉😊
I would give 60% credit to leach for successfully facing dot balls n keeping calm
"When you have passion and luck with you 
You can do anything in this world 🎉❤"
One of the greatest days of sport I’ve ever witnessed. Unreal.
What a innings ❤❤❤All time greatest
One of the greatest test matches ever
What a match 😮😮
The best unbeaten single ever made by jack leach 👏👏👏
I think this match is fixed......5 coincidences are impossible....
"England mostly wins matches because of luck 
This match and 2019 WC finals"
Test lover ❤❤❤
Last seen.  Is absolutely  goosebumps
And kids still think they are cricket fans after watching ipl and 20-20 wc. There is nothing as exciting as a test match.
when pat cummins wasted that review just like that...all knew he is going to regret at end....
You see a great ben stokes innings and 100% sure there was some luck.  Every great innings literally at least has one blunder from umpire or fielders or his bat deflecting ball 😅😅 underrated cheater/lucky guy
Tim Payne's descision to take review cost them the ashes.
"But actually aus won
..umpire gave wrong out"
No one will say match was fixed... 😂
2024 still 🔥
Don't forget the contribution of Joel Wilson 😅
"See the crowd it look likes t20 match..
This is the real beauty of test cricket 🏏🏏🏏🏏🙈😍🦗"
"Great but definitely not the greatest test innings, no, there are many many contenders that would easily better this."
when he reached 50 not celebrated not even at a ton raised the bat after clearing the mark...thats ben stokes !!
Umbire Supper🥵
Wholly supported by crowd
Ben Stokes the Spartan 💪
15:24 goosebumps
"I love that bit of commentary from Nicholas on the Lyon missed run out where he's commentating as normal then loses it and goes ""It's just too much. It's too much for everybody"""
WE DONT NEED A STADIUM OF 130 K+ CAPACITY TO  ENJOY CRICKET ..we need the intoxic fans who love their player but not become toxic fans ..like msd ( dont get hurt)..even a batsman is out due to inside edge..fans will say that it was plan of dhoni or mastermind
Tim why do u waste review willingly
career defining moment for stokes 
"Be patient. Be courageous . Never give up. When its your time , destiny will give you things you never even imagined . BENJAMIN G STOKES didn't celebrate anything before last runs , he built partnerships before all came down to him , crazy brave shots , attacking batting .. destiny surrenders .. couple of close catches goes to sixes , harris drops the catch , stupid paine takes review out of desperation , lyon misses one of the easiest of runouts .. & then you see life time moment of 17:07..."
Stokes play well no doubt but Credit goes to umpire for his bad decision
One of the greatest one.. Tight slap on Aussie 🎉
"ECB is probably one of the few cricket boards that know how to upload highlights!

I remember watching this live on TV and ECB didnt leave out any single moment unlike other channels."
6:34 does anyone hear 'पकड'
Butler was not out.😮
As lucky as it gets. For me Ben Stokes just happened to be lucky in many occasions including the world cup 2019 final.
"Rubbish match,totally a fixer, catches were dropped, run out chances went into vain, experienced umpire didn't give out."
That first ball from Hazelwood 🥵
"Start video from 17.00 and finish at 17.15 

Its goosebumps, its Gladiator, its Achilles , its Sparta !!

It’s everything man🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻"
Man takes many Births to live this moment!!❤❤
Great innings
"This was 5 years ago. I still get goosebumps and a lump in my throat when I watch it. Is there something wrong with me?!?!
It is absolute sheer theatre of the highest HIGHEST order.
Even down to the little sub-plots - like  Australia throwing away their last review and then 
desperately needing it with just TWO runs left to get...
AND the back story that came before it - the previous 4 days - Englands terrible first innings...
Everything about this was - perfect."
Ghatiya captain hain paine
What a match!!One of the best entertaining test match ever seen.Thanks stokes!!
Goose bumps
But how was Buttler out ??
Goosebumps. Undoubtedly the best test match inning ever seen.
"Greatest test inning...???
Yes..🔥"
14:03 australia tastes the defeat at here 🫠🫠
Sometimes it takes an effort from all 11 players at the field and sometimes a will of just one...
2023 wc maxwel🔥🔥
Bhen stokes
Lyon😂
Yu hi nhi ye banda Virat Kohli ka favourite player h ❤
😮😮
Poor umpiring 😢
The greatest match of all time ❤❤
Ben stokes is great in all world.
Greatest inning played by individiual in all forms of cricket irrespective of the situation.
Leach contribution is the most important thing.
This is a thriller abouslete thriller worth to make a movie on it with all its twist and turns
The cosmos played against Aussies that day..
Exactly the same thing happened once again..😮 🙏🏾
Australia lost when they took the review for that Outside Leg stump ball. That review costed them too much 😅 13:21
"Australian fielding in ashes : 🤡 
Australian fielding in World Cup final :"
Oh Ben!! What are you doing to this cricket match.. favourite commentator.. Mark Nicholas
Ben Stokes best now
"What a goosebumps in fans, b🎉"
"England Win Credits

The Umpire Who Made Wrong Decision 😅
Ben Stokes Who Played Great Innings


Great Thanks To Nathon Lyon 😅😂😂❤"
What a Fantastic Match ❤
Thats why cricket is a game of luck. Lyon would have done that run out 9/10 times times but he missed at that time
"Best cricket ground, Ben Stokes take a bow"
The umpire would have been definitely cursed by every man from Australia
What an inning by Ben stokes but poor umpairing
One of the best ever match of cricket era & best innings stoksy
"Australia fielding in ashes : 🤡
Australia fielding in wc final : 💀
Whyy😥😥"
"One of the best cricket moments 
I just can’t get over this"
"the same umpire joel wilson, just a gentle reminder to english fans 😉"
How many times you see this video you will feel real goosebumps
Poetry in motion it was 🫡
great knock
I don't know how many times i watched this test match. One of the greatest match of the cricket history.
Is match me bhi England ka lucky tha jaisa World Cup final me NZ😢 ke samne         Well played stocks 🔥
The crowd 🥵🥵
i would say australia was quite unlucky in this match and ben stokes was just unbelievable what a patience what a will😉😉
Aus is cheater there is no run out but they didn't tell
T20 test match
Give me goosebumps every time I see this....
"Catch drop on 116 run out chance when 2 needed and wrong umpiring decision when 2 needed 
Cricket is a game of coincidence ( or may be a game where on every ball huge money involved) 😅"
Amazing❤❤❤❤
The greatest test everrrrrr in historyyyyy
This is the perfect example of the dialogue KEHTE HAI KISI CHIZ KO DIL SE CHAHO TOH PURI QAYENAT USSE TUMSE MILANE KI KOSHISH MEIN LAG JATI H😂😂
No doubt test cricket is the best format ever ❤ t20 kids never understand that
Test Match ❤❤
"2 catch drops.
Run out Miss.
Wrong lbw decision.
It was God that made England win this test match not Ben stokes.😂"
The greatest test knock ever
But you supporting bazball theory. 😢😢 i dont like.
The lbw was not given yaar😢
ben stokes you beauty✨♥️
That was Plumb LBW😊
Best test innings in the run chase.
All Time Best Test innings in cricket History 😮😮😮

15:26
17:05
One of the greatest innings in the history of test cricket. Wonder what's happened to him this series in India.
The gabba test between india and Australia where india won is just as good as this 🔥
Watching 60th time.still getting goosebumps.
"I do wonder ,is joel wilson the worst in business or what , he is on fire in the current ind vs eng series too 😂😂"
Cricket is the best sport
Where is the video now after 434 runs defeat 🤣🤣

KUSAL JANITH = BEN STOKES  (2019)🏏
Umpires won for England
A true warior ben stokes❤❤❤
"Incredible game! I was thinking to myself during the time when Australia took the review at the end out of desperation ""Imagine if another actual wicket would occur but you don't have a review to take it"" and just a few minutes later it actually happened..."
Nature is with him many times can be catched but not can be run out and no review left when he is out🔥
Australia won it like three times but this was just stokes luck running sky high. Same for the nz final 2019
Maxwell and Stokes and Kohli....Wow
Well credit goes to Lyon
The greatrst 1 run of all time
When you take last remaining review unnecessarily 😮
❤❤❤❤ 17:06 🥵🥵❣️
East are west...test is the best ❤...what aaaaa matchhhhh...❤
Heart touching match💘💘💘🔥🔥👌👌❤❤
Australia was depressed by his innings. Look at the number of nervous decisions they had taken. Taking last review for nothing was waste.
"That was a proper LBW at the end, imagine Aus didn’t lose their review 😮"
The best test match ever
The legendary Ben Stones 🙌 👏 👌

Why ECB shows complete vdos of their own players always..while they always cut half of innings of pther overseas players...thats pathetic
"I’m seeing the video version for the first time… even though knows what happened, but it still thrilling.. just WOWWW"
I am pure fan of test cricket

Hazelwood had everything this match, inswing-outswing, back of the length, Yorker, bouncer. 
What a bowler."
"Best Test Match of all time? Don't know, but the best Ashes commentary by far ❤"
I can't tell u the amount of times I watched this during lockdown
That no lbw call was ridiculous
Aus vs eng test matches are not boring because they are playing ashes and there is enough crowd to make these matches great
"That's  a test match , Oh what a match , stokes won the match     . from   BANGLADESH"
Aus didn't deserve this match to be won by them. They had got plenty of chances but they didn't get hold of any. Aus is worthless😂😂😂
One of the best match of the cricket history
9:50 💥👍

Virat and Stokes are Modern day Greats❤❤

Very very dramatic match 😅😊😊😅😅
All indians Came here after Watching the clip where  Benstroke celebrates while crowd behind him was also shouting for their victory.
Ben Stokes is Treasure of ENGLAND🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
what a dumb review that was by Paine.
"That Nathan Lyon over was easily the most frustrating, saddest over for England, Australia and the umpire haha. But England took, 'when god gives you a second chance,' to 'when god gives 3 chances.' Real heartbreak for Lyon that cost him the Ashes."
Unfair decision of Nathan lyon 🥲
Wow ben stokes
Test match have no comparison
"Video Started with Bang on Helmet,video ended with Big Bang..😅"
Worse Umpiring ever
"England jab bhi bade matches jiti hai,hamesa beimani se jiti hai"
It was Stokes day. He got so many lives.
Benjamin Stokes is a fckin warrior.
🔥🏏 cricket
"This is a legendary innings. But why is no one talking about Kusal Perera's 153* against South Africa.
It was just as good or even better than this innings (one of the best innings ever)
- Played against South Africa in South Africa
- The South African bowling attack was really powerful (likes of Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada and Keshav Maharaj)
- Protected his wicket from opening to the end and protected the 9th wicket by staying on strike
- Only place where Ben Stokes innings is better is the importance of the match

Why can't we even see a proper video of this gem of an innings"
Pure goosebumps 🔥🔥
❤❤❤
Long live test cricket ❤
Goosebumps
Umpire be the reason of England to win 😂
Umpire not given Out 😮
Thats why virat kohli taking his name in every match 😅😅

"The great Ben stokes ❤
Love from India 🇮🇳.. 
One of my fav player from england cricket team☺"
"Didn't even raise the bat at 50, didn't celebrate the 100. All of it came out when he won it for his country. What emotions! It shows how much the win mattered. Absolutely magical. Only the heavens could have scripted something like this. And of course, the crowd rising with him, that was absolutely insane. Haven't seen anything like that before. 👏👏👏👏👏👏"
Man English Crowd Is Something Else Bro
Very bad sportsmanship and bad decision from the umpire Australia already won the match ❤
Ben stokes always had a good luck. He was out at 14:33 however it's because of umpire's decision England won. Even in world cup he got extra 4 runs by luck.
17:02 I know you came here for this!!
Greatest test innings ever played ❤❤
❤
What a movement for Ben stock❤
13:21 the stupidest decision.. What cost aus. The match...

Poor umpireing
What if Joel Wilson gave stokes out on 131🥶💀💀💀

"This is not an innings, this is a motivational video. Every time I sit down on my desk for work, I see this video to get charged."
Although Stokes played well still Wilson one of the worst umpire can't give a proper decision Aussies would have won it

England crowd is Best in the world
He is legend
Umpire cheating 😂
👍👍👍
Best innings i have ever seen

Boring match

Aise Matches ki Wajah se hi Test Cricket Zinda Hai
Nice one benstoks but virat kohli 82 run vs Pakistan is the most incredible ining by kohli all time in cricket history❤❤❤❤❤
Nathan Lyn LBW is clearly out
Australia winner but umpire decision made England winner
Lucky england
"Umpire had Gone on his Ego. Because last time tim Paine take a review on a right decision that's not make any sense to take review on 13:30  that Yorker ball. Now umpire said it was my time i gabe worng decision. Would you have power to convert my decision to not out to out😂 Lol moment for Tim Paine..

4:03  Catch drop.
12:09  Again catch drop.  
14:36 Reaview miss. 
13:58 And last run out miss..
 that's all mistake from a single side..they don't deserve this match to win"
"Catch drop,run out miss,not out given by empire.. well played"
Foolishness by the Australians ... Run out chance missed and used a review for no reason and at end paid the prize because Ben Stokes was out in the previous over
Ben stokes is hero
Test matches r toughest... Agnipariksha h test match player ki. T20 or odi me ko koi bhi run bana leta. Test ki tough pitch pr players ki ability pta chalti h
You can't fate if it's written.
Congratulation  BEN stokes good  batting
"Ben Stokes is another legend after few in my age ..Lara, Flintoff, Sachin,  Virat and Pant"
"Those drop catches, those missed run outs, those umpiring decisions, that's how you put someone under pressure...Ben Stokes u beauty 🎉"
Ben stokes unstoppable inings jack leach the hero
Modern ian botham (from india)

🏏💥🏏💥🏏
First Ben stokes and then rishabh pant... Tim Paine had a lot of pain in his career.
If Bhagwan hmsa Bahaduro ka saath deeta haii had a face

"The latest trailer for the ICC Men’s ODI World Cup 2023 is receiving mockery on social media for the scarce representation of Pakistan.

The video heavily features Indian, Australian, and England teams, while skipping other teams. Pakistan was featured in a few scenes, each scene of less than a second, mostly showing challenging and defeating moments of Pakistan throughout the ICC World Cups"
The greatest test match of all time🎉
goosebumps ben stokes
It's Possible If It's Ben Stokes 🥶
One man army — ben stokes
Fixing at its best..miscue by leon was delibrate ..2
Ben 🥵🔥❤️
"The celebration 😎😎😎🥰🥰
17:05"
Taste of the test match😍
England 9 down and Stokes was plum LBW and it was given not out. Karma is losing the 2023 Ashes to rain 🌧️😂
"Turning points of match
1. Dropped catch of Ben Stokes.
2. LBW Appeal of Jack Leach by Australian team and loosing review and when Nathan Lyon appealed for LBW that moment if Australian team hadn't wasted the review they could have won the match easily. 

How many agree 👍"
"jack leach , you are my hero , the greatest 1* of all time 💯"
Very well batting from Jack leach also he play 17 bowl of fast bowler. Indian player need to learn from him.
Australia almost there😂
"Dropped catches , run out misses , the given not out but do not have a review"
"""Whenever ashes series are played, it reminds me this match"" Greatest, Exceptional, Phenomenal Stocksy!🗿🗿"
Ben stokes ❤
Leach is man of the match 😅😅
Kitni baar bhi dekhlu rona hi aata hai har baar😢
"Conclusion: LUCK also matters for that last step to success, rather than all that HARDWORK"
11:36 what a shot that was!!
😊😊
This match is not 138partnership for last wicket
Sir
"To me Ben Stokes is backed by some unseen power given by God and also backed by something we never know which he might know. Maybe his patents prayers or what. But whenever i see him on the field, it gives me sense of power, courage and success in England cricket. I hope, one day Ben Stokes unseen power and fortune will be revealed. Imran from Pakistan"
15:23
15:07
17:06
What a match unbelievable 😮
no lie...it was all fixed...umpires Australians etc all were forced to let england win and if it was happen in any pak_ind match and then everyone could make objections on it
When England win they always win special 😊
The match was lost..the umpire didnt give the lbw
You are a real hero
I think this match is fix
After this match I'm continuing watching test cricket specialy eng vs aus
"England always win by cheating , this ashes, the odi world cup 2019 . They are the biggest cheaters"
"Joel Wilson with the greatest umpire call of all time, he knew what he was doing ;)"
"He kept his cool until the last ball. He did not celebrate his century, when he hit that last run his emotions just exploded"
He does belong to england 😅😂😂
Love from india
What a match
England won because of the umpire
Unbelievable 😧
"Who was man of the match, I forget."
Bro did 1v11 ❤❤
Isn’t it the best Test Cricket Match we Have Ever Watched ??? 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The greatest test innings of all time
You can feels thrilled from 12:00
"Main attracted thing is Gallery is full of supporters. 
They appreciate every ball ❤"
Indian batters should learn something from him
One man army for England🇬🇧
Well done and no sand paper used 😂😂😂😂
Leach has to be the hero of this as he survived such deadly balls 😮
Stoke class and good luck also help them
Australia always good in crunch situation but in this match they didn't
India desperately needs Ben Stokes like players❤❤
What a match❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ben stokes is big matches player 2019 wc final win 22 wc final win 2019 ashes win ❤❤❤ its 4 years ago but in 23 how it is possible ❤
Only This man knows how to play in pressure situation The Real king of cricket The King Stokes
9:48 shot of heaven
Ben Stokes what a champion player he is great treat to watch him
We had to give the game to the English team just to shut them up with all the bullying 😤 😔 😪
Credits to the editor for showing the Dot Balls played by Leach ✨
Playing test like t20😂😂
Not just good batting only but also bad fielding too 😢😢😢
Who is here after his heroic 155 inning in lords 🔥🔥
Did you notice he didn't celebrate his fifty and hundred but when England won his celebration was top notch
Only thing that is despising in this entire match is Esha Guha's commentary.
This knock from Lord Stokes made the dying Test Cricket live for next 100 years!
Warner lyon umpire the culprits
Great win & England deserves it.. Australia shld have been won by 1 run if they had a review left.
"Well done the Aussies, great sportsmanship."
Watching it 3rd time. Everytime gives me goosebumps.
I was there that day. What am incredible day
"What if, Paine just didn't burn the LBW review?
What if Lyon executed the run out?
Not all sixes are clean hits, may end up at bowler throat.
Despite all, Stokes carried the team home.Sometimes, it's just Destiny."
The miracle at headingley
"I was at this game with my boyfriend and someone touched my bottom,"
Surely luck do favoured England.
Kismat bhi Bahadur ka sath deti hai
Legend player 👍
Gabba mai pant aur ashes mai Ben stokes ne le Li inki
Stokes is best. It is a terrific batting
What About Umpire Decision 2 runs needs for England 🥱🥱🥱🥱
But lyon out stokes already but they aussies don't have drs thats way they lost
Ashesh is the only test series which is better than t20
Nice world class performance by ben stocks extra ordinary 👍👍👍👍👍👍
Ben Stokes is the remarkable cricketer.
Worlds cheater team is australia never play fair game
Ben stokes inning= all time ashes
Hanesty umpire won match stokes lbw
"5:30 Aus should have save the review, a very bad decision made from them"
Bestest rivalry to watch what a knock by Ben stokes
Greatest batting in the history of test match sensational 😊
Whenever I think I’m down and out in life I come back to this innings.
"No doubt one of the greatest test matches ever played. But that was a clear LBW, even the worst umpire would have given that out. I mean just look at Australia - dropping catches, miss fields , missing a easy runout . I don't know man, maybe a lot of people backed Aussies to win the game."
"What a match Ben
Lots of love from India"
Everyone praises stokes for his hundred but no-one praises leach for his single
Full entertainment Beautyfull inning Ben stokes
The cricketer stokes❤
"What a combination

Ben Stokes & Mark Nicholas"
The scream and raw emotion after hitting the perfect 4 to win the test match gives me goose bumps every time.
"Ben stokes was the villain for losing 2016 T20 world cup but after that
Headingley 2019 
Odi wc 2019
T20 wc 2022 was won by England because of him.
Hats off stokes the greatest clutch player of modern cricketing Era."
It was truly lucky from England side
In 2023 stokes almost one more done the same things 😮
Ben couldn't handle it he had mental issues after that .... Mental Health is very important and it's really dangerous
Ooo Ben what are you doing to this test match.
Ooo Ben what are you doing to this test match.
Most incredible ending.
इस मैच ने गांड़ फाड़ दिया था इंग्लैंड की 😂😂😂
Greatest test match inning..
can someone explain to me how Buttler got out when Lyon himself hit the stumps as opposed to the ball??
Ben Stokes will retire as one of the greatest all rounders of all time.
"Hello Russian propergandist, what happened in Avdiivka? Did Russian's lose 20+ armoured vehicles and about 200 troops? Do you need more time to spin this? 🤣"
Wish my Grandad could have seen that innings. RIP Kenneth King. Impeccable performance.
9.56. Reverse. Shot of the day
"Now headingly 2023, they won at the same pitch."
"Who is here after lord's 155 run 
Attendance please 😊😊😊😊"
Only Stokes can do this nobody can match Ben Stokes I repeat Nobody. 2019 World cup win 2022 t20 world cup this ashes test Stokes is on another level . No body can match his level of match winni g knocks in big matches No Dhoni No kohli Only Stokes Ben Stokes
Here after Stokes' 155
1 man of army
"The greatest innings i have ever seen in my entire 38 years on this planet. Brings a tear to my eye rewatching it. 

The highlights just seem to be endless repetition of Aussies desperately flinging themselves about trying to stop the ball crossing the boundary."
"14:52
How can it not be a decision of out, Mr. Joe Wilson!?

literally, Aussies would have won the match as well as the series....."
It’s not Ben stokes who won the game for England it’s that umpire who didn’t gave stokes out in that LBW
best Ashes test match ever by a long margin
Leach with that unbeatable 1 run>>>
And they say cricket is boring. Whereas the most boring cricket is enough to get filled with excitement
5th of match Australia always panic against left handers . Ben stokes and Rishab pant are the best example 😂😂😂
"Aussies bottled that one

Run out leading by 2 (lyon drops it)

Then the throw away review comes back to haunt

Fking seething seeing this for first time"
14:37 what Happen if umpire ups Finger
This is cricket history one in only test match ❤
Test match is real royal cricket
13:27....a review to remember
leach is the true hero
Easy out not given...England cheating fully spoted
Well batting Ben stoke but LBW wicket umpire not out😅
An inning that will be remembered for ages.
England's victory in this match is fixed.
Ben Stocks remember the name
Why do we have to have women commentating on men’s sport? They know nothing and sound stupid
imagine how much bet has gone to this match😂😂😂
It's called TEST For reason ❤😍
Bairstow is the worst player in test cricket!!
Nathon lyon is the culprit who miss run out
This is unfare stock was lbw our
I got emotional re-watching that
"Match is.  England<<<<<<<Australia,, bcause of umpire decision not changed🫣"
You know a run chase video is special when you’re when still biting your nails having already seen it like 10 times.
Again winning on headingley today 9th July 2023.
"Test match : ""a poetry in motion❤️"""
Hatts off to Jack Leach too🙌💓🔥💯
It's That Time Again For Stokes
Best Test Match Ever
Hairs up on the back of the neck job this. Amazing stuff
Ben Stokes Finishes Off In Style 🔥.
Most exciting test series ive seen in ages but the whinging pommes are carrying on like they have won the series because they won by 1 wicket seriously
honestly name a better fucking thing than stokes and headlingly
In my top 10 sporting performances ever.
Australia lost match due to Nathan Lyon and not due to Ben Stokes
Bas life Mai. Ekbar England Mai test dekhna hain 😬
No one tastes glory without a lil bit of luck...
Great match
"ben stokes played well but the level of umpiring was very low
and also there was 1 mistake don by pain he took review without any reason"
That's called standing up.
"Australia shaking hands and congratulating everyone so nicely, just as the spirit of cricket dictates"
Bhen stokes 😮 ❤
Just rewatching this before it happens again in two days time
We want more like this
I still remember it ohh god
Wrong umpiring otherwise Eng lost
Who watches Second Test Ashe's 2023 Ben stoke Innings 155❤🎉 🥳
The Best test 4th innings ever in cricket history
The incredible Ben stokes❤
Umpire’s decision at the end though madness!!! As plum as youll see but let me tell ya im happy he flappd it!!! Lol
Lyon missing the runout and Aus out of reviews - Luck favours the brave moment
Ben stokes can handle difficult situation easily
"By the way, England lost it by 1 run had there been one review left with Australia 😂"
I still can't believe England won this.!
Thank you hero to test match convert to t10😍
Greatest test of all time
Jack Leach's golden 1*(17)👌🏽👌🏽
"You will just never get better drama in any sport, ever than that. Just incredible. You can't beat the Ashes. The roar when Stokes got the winning run actually affected the microphones in the stadium! They were momentarily distorted because of the noise. You only usually hear that if Barca score a wonder goal in the Camp Nou or a winning goal in the River Plate - Boca derby."
"One of the greatest innings by Ben Stokes in his test carrier, single handly win the match for England 😎😎🔥🔥🔥"
"Ben is a star

We're as leach is super star"
I have watched this video about 5472390 times and Im still bricking it even though I know what happens
What a dodgy umpire.....Stokes should have walked...in the spirit of cricket....he was out LBW but a gutless umpire would not call it
He could have been out 5 times....thats karma
9ne of the best ever match of all time🎉🎉🎉!!!
Ben stokes hero of an epic
That day stokes and luck affair beats aussies
True Legend  .... Kohli . Rohit . Babar no One Compare with Ben stokes. True match winner on Big Occasion.
Vintage king 👑 Virat ❤️ th..my second favourite player is Ben stokes ☺️
They won this by luck. Had Stokes done the same thing on the 2nd test it would have been skills vs luck. England needs to sack some of their top order atleast 4 of the top 6 and find some new players.
"Leach was marvelous... It is just because of him, stocks could do something like that....  Best defence by leach"
"Both the teams played well .Ben stoke done the impossible deed .but ,I would like to say,the Aussies deserved that win ,though they missed 2 big opportunities,there was a lbw,might that not be their day"
Zero to hero Ben stokes
Umpire wrong decision lbw when 2 run remains
Cant believe the umpire didn’t give that plum wicket and aus wasted there last review on something pitched outside of leg so unlucky should of been Australia’s game through and through umpire should be sacked still cant believe it even watching 4 years later
"What a fighter , what a batsman ... superlative innings from gutsy Stokes .... Stokes n Rishab Pant are best in tests in this generation ....Cinematic innings from Stokes ..... when ever i feel deprresd , will watch this innings to gain confidence again 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪"
"For Aus 359 is bad total at every time
Like 359 vs Ind 2013 in jaipur odi

IND vs Aus border gavesker trophy 😂😂😂😂
And this match 😅😅😅😅"
Take this something similar on Monday if not before… COE…
❤
"14 : 38 bad decision by umpire 
Otherwise Australia have won"
Poor captaincy... Australia ought to have won the game if He hadn't taken the review.
One of the greatest innings great work ❤❤❤❤
"Dropped catches, missed run out, missed lbw. It was a one in 100000 innings"
Love you stokesy❤
Test cricket>>>>>>>>>>>>>any format just pure strokes defensive what not every ball in ashes is so dramatic
An inspiration to all to never give up until it’s over.
What the f*ck was jack leach doing there. Still winds me up.
"17:01 
'The maestro wielding his wand in a majestic play and the the music dancing in a perfect sync, in elation!!'

I replayed this moment a hundred times atleast. I'm not a England cricket fan but I get goosebumps by this moment."
ya match umpire ki vajah sa hi hari thi Aussie
Tim paine who costs Australia this match bloody handshaker and rapist
greatest knock of all time
Goosebumps 🥵
ben stokes is just amazing and dont forget leach
That’s How India Should Play Against Aussies……Seekhoo kuchhh🙂🫡
"Sorry to say but the English players are hypocrites. Nobody cares about Stuart Broad but I didn't expect such a statement from Ben Stokes.

For context:

In 2013: Stuart Broad edged a ball from Ashton Agar and it was caught in the first slip, it was a very thick edge. DRS wasn't available. Umpire gave it not out and Stuart Broad well, never thinks he's out.

In the 2019 ODI World Cup Final: Stokes got over throw runs (which wasn't his fault) because of which England won the game and even the world cup. He could have been the bigger man and not accepted those runs as they were legal but against the spirit of the game. He should have then accepted only 2 runs or a dead ball.

In the 2019 Ashes headingly test: 

When 2 runs were required to win, Nathan Lyon bowled and appealed for an LBW. The umpire gave it not out, Australia were out of reviews, but the cameras showed it was out. He could have walked off after seeing it on the big screen, but didn't. And he won the game because of that.

Last year:
Ollie Pope stumped Colin de grandhomme the same way.

This game:
Bairstow tried to stump Warner at the start of the game, but missed.

And their coach Brendon McCullum has done it atleast 3 times in his career, one of which was in a game against England in the 2009 Champions Trophy. And their captain was Daniel Vettori, the current Australian Spin Bowling Coach. 😂

So for Ben or Baz to say that they wouldn't want to win a game that way or Broad saying to Carey that's all you would be remembered for, think again. 

I will always remember Broad for 2 things, 6 sixes by Yuvraj and failing to walk off in the 2013 Ashes Test match.

It doesn't take long for the English fans (and some cricket gentlemen, including those from the MCC) to turn into football hooligans."
I came here to watch benstokes heroics for 5th time😅😅😅😅 how many of you in 2023
I feel sorry for nathen lyon.Because ben stocks was lbw in that over.
This is the most dramatic test match ending till date..may be!
"17:00 to 17:14...Quite an amazing scene, especially with Nathan Lyon in the foreground in stark contrast to Ben's and the crowd's celebration."
Unreal chase but he was out tho lbw
Stokes was immense!
HANDS DOWN THE GREATEST TEST INNINGS OF ALL TIME! Watching this for the 100th time and yet goosebumps every single time
He could've repeated this
That 17:11 view 🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌
Australia must have realised that you should never ever take a desperate review when you know it's clear not out. Had they not taken the wrong review they would have been won it by taking the review in the very end. Ben stokes incredible 🔥
Hit like if you came here after yesterday Stokes 155 at Lord's. Truly fighter Stokes 🙌
Deja Vu denied in 2023 Ashes😊
A match australia ko jitna chaiye tha run out 2 catch drop lech ke khilaf faltu me review nai lete to stock ke khilaf review kam aa jata but englend is lucky 😅
Again N again Stokes ❤
That sync at 17:07 🤩🤩
❤
Like Virat says..”BEHEN STOKESSS” 🎉🎉🎉❤
"""For Headingley 1981 read Headingley 2019"""
"For y'all reminder Brian Lara 153 against Australia will always be greatest innings ever,Did yall see remember Australia bowling Attacks"
Ben stokes is one of greatest intelligent cricketer for England and we love his boldness and style
17:07 perfectly synced 🔥
Almost repeated yesterday..but hard luck 💔
Me after Ben stokes iconic innings in Lords. You are hero Ben Stokes ❤️. The whole world will never forget your these 2 innings.

Now a days i more loving test cricket
"Hello, 2023 ashesh lords test!! Ben stokes, you can't be that crunch moment player,n"
He almost did it again today 😆
"He agian played a masterclass innings yesterday though in a losing cause but we should appreciate and celebrate his grateness. So I shouldn't miss the chance of rewatching one of the most spirited and fantastic knock in test cricket ! He is a Genius player. Always stands up for his country in most critical situations, Champion !! ❤"
But stokes was fabulous ❤❤❤❤
Wrong decision made eng win😢😢😢😢
It's a tradition to visit this masterpiece once in a while.
"Umpire gives not out, Lyon misses run Out... Nice script"
But was buttler's run out genuine out tho?
Who is here after Stokes 155 in the 5th day of second test (Ashes)??
after stokes knock in 2nd innings of 2nd test ashes 2023 true warrior
So basically Aus would have won this If they hadn't wasted their review.
The fact that this is in my recommendation after the stokes heroics at Lord's ❤‍🩹
Who came here after today's innings by Stokes at Lords. Deja vu it would have been but unlucky this time... yet another masterclass from the greatest allrounder this game have ever witnessed.❤
2-0 👍 🇦🇺
"Oh my, English fans losing their tiny minds. The Aussies must be winning again…."
Storming stocks 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Rewatching the innings after 155 in another ashes(2023). Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
this is comfort watching today
Who is watching after today's ben stokes 155 in ashes 2nd test😣😣😮‍💨another legendary knock👏👏 ben stokes man of big occasions🔥
Here after stokes again nearly pulled off a miracle😢 would have been perfect sequel to this headingley miracle
Stokes 155*
"Man, got this recommended after today's Stokes heroics gone vain!"
"Just Came here after heroic 155 by Ben Stocks in 2nd ashesh,, he almost created the same atmosphere in lords like headingly..!! Just fell short but man what an inning again..!!❤❤"
Today he can same things but he short 43 runs
It would have been repeated today's as well..All time great ben stokes
Who here after almost he win Lord's test for his country
This time in Ashes it wasn't repeated ..so satisfied😌
Goosebump stokes 155 today the real rivalry
"Came here after Stokes hit 155 against the Aussies today (Ashes 2023, Lords) 

Just a quick comment on what Aussie's did to get Bairstow out. Of course it's within the rules. And of course it's also against the spirit of the cricket. Mancade is within the rules too. You can do it to win, nobody can tell you it's wrong as it's within the rules. It's just against the spirit of the game."
He couldn't repeat it again 😭
Who is here after Ben stokes today's Knock 😢✨
best test match ever 😱
Here after today.
Today Another brilliant knock by stocks but this time mission not completed ❤️🥵
Who all have come after stokes scoring 155 vs aus today at lords

Waiting for heroic of Ben Stokes again 02/07/2023
Broad should also support him if they wanted to win today
Who else is watching this today - hoping this happens again
"Again a hundred at lords in the 4th inning today in a very very pressurised situation . What a gem , what a player, what a leader . One of the goat all rounder . Love from india 🇮🇳"
Ben is doing the same in lords ❤
Ben stokes is going repeating this incredible thing in todays match
Ben stoke 2.0 2/07/2023
Sad to see no one came running towards Stokes after winning such an impossible one
Oooo leach... The frightened
Can we see this kind of innings today? Only God knows.
It will be happen again today
tomorrow history will repeat
Anyone else here ahead of tomorrow...
This by far the greatest one man army innings in test cricket history
"14:34 Lyon Paid back the price of his blunder and the job was done.. Unfortunately, no review were remained.."
All time my fav Test match🎉
When god is with you😇😁
Somebody said correctly that a test match is a real test.
One of best day of all test matches
"Watched this over 200 times 
And never gets bored 
Ben you beauty ❤
Test cricket at its best ❤❣️"
Nice script--
Umpire decision is worost in last over .and a great innings by ben...and easy run out missed up by lyon..overall...a great ups and down victory for England..a..it's looked like a world cup victory ...game against newzealand....
damn umpire save england as always
"The man, the myth, the legend Ben stokes 😎"
England ka Karishma dekho Ben stokes ka catch drop Australian car review khatm run out ka mauka Chhota nahin Ho Paya review ke Karan and many other reasons vatan match❤
The time when test cricket becomes T20 match ❤
What a match drama❤❤
I don't remember a cricketer who is more clutch than Ben Stokes. Maybe the Australian cricket team of 2000's
I am from india but really I like ben stocks
"Ben stokes best in the world 🌎🌎
All time best all rounder in the world 🌎🌎"
"First time I saw australia panic EVER. poor reviews, poor catching, missed runouts, poor bowling"
I think Australia deserved to win but because of there and umpires decision they lost
"I feel so bad for Jofra. The guy dug in and was more use than half of our top/middle order. 

“Stokes will be disappointed”, get lost. We’ll miss him, this series."
Clearing 9 fielders in boundary
One of the best chase of Century in Test Match history
No one is talking about leach 😢
💪💪💪💪 Stokes😮😮😮
Well played umpire😂😂😂😂 all credit goes to him for his great innings
"Eng always wins bcz of bad decisions of umpires and bad rules of icc. Yes , England wins without winning ( mostly)
😞"
Ben stoke 🔥🔥🔥
"I like.
THIS game..."
Way too many twists! Was it fixed? 😂
14.59 Aus..win❤
I honestly think test matches are so boring bc they take so long but there actually quite breathtaking moments
One of the greatest 🔥🔥👌
"He was not play for him, He played for his team ❤"
A legend Ben Stokes ❤❤❤
The most corrupt test match ever. Nathan Lyon gets Ben Stokes absolutely lbw but they call it not out. Disgraceful stuff from these knuckleheads
"12:14 Marcus harris drops the catch
13:19 Tim Paine's review
14:00 Lyon misses run out
14:36  Joe wilson giving not out to a LBW in later showed all three red and australia not having review left coz they just took the last review out of desparation.
 oh my gosh! How many easy chances for australia and yet they lost. It was destiny for stokes and england to win this match and the Ashes. The beauty of cricket.
🔥"
"I still regret turning off the tv when 9th wicket fell.
2 hours later, possibly the greatest innings in a test saw England win the match.
It's been 4 years, i repeatedly see it again and again but the regret seems intact 😭"
India kab kregi esa karnama 😢
Edgbaston 2005 and Headingley 2019. Memories for the ages.
Again proved England is luckiest team ever !!
Finally world is round everything comes right back💯
17:00🔥
Umpire make England win😊
Ben stokes great all rounder
Test matches in Aus and England are better than Odis & t20s🔥🔥
Great innings but he was clearly out lbw??? Surely Aussies were outraged
All indians in comments 😂 no aus no English people this shows they doesn’t even care about cricket
Man of the match umpire
What a match.
Ben stock one of the best all-rounder in world cricket 🏏🏏🔥🔥👍👍
"What a match !!!! 
Nathan Lyon didn't drop the ball....He dropped the 5 day match in a sec"
I don't know why but whenever eng play aus ....I support eng
GOAT 😮
"Whenever i feel sad or stressed, this video genuinely makes everything better. What an innings, what a man! Was driving back home during the game so had to listen on the 5live as the wickets tumbled - 10/10 would do again."
This match is Action drama and suspens😄🍊
Itney chances toh bhagwaan ko bhi nahi milteh. World Cup final bhi aisey hi hua tha. Paisa bolta hai.
Saale angrez cheating se hi jitte hai angrejo ki aukat nhi jite
What a drama 😮❤
"I was only 14 years old when I witnessed this legendary Ton Live.... Ben Stokes made me the luckiest person on earth by giving these back to back matches... 
1.) The CWC Final
2.) The Legends of Headingley...."
"17:07 Goosebump scene 
WATCH AND THANKS ME LATER"
well done stokes u r the legend for England cricket
"no words for lyon.
he missed runout but the next ball he done for his team"
no no no budy this is wrong this is totally wrong how wilson done that. that was plum lbw. this level of umpireing is shameful. won of the most stupid decision i have ever seen
"Watching this after Australia defeated England at Edgbaston , the reversal of Destinies, Ben dropped a catch yesterday , Lyon missed a run out in this game , whataaaaaaaaaaaa game."
"Ben stokes not raised his bat on century...not like Indian cricketers who celebrates even half century in d world cup semis...!
Moral:- Dont celebrate until finishe ur work...!"
Everything went wrong for aus
"Test match is truely son of game of cricket ..
T20 and odi najayaj aulad hai"
ben stokes was cleeanly out but the umpire was paid
Actual match started at 9:25 ....Thank me later🙌
we all know why are we here?
Kudos to Ben Stokes 🎉💐🎊 as a indian fan yuvraj singh also best all rounder india ever produced but not getting as much as fame compared to other teams match winners. In fact Yuvi performances brought us both T20 world cup 2007 & ODI world cup 2011. 🙏🏻🎉💓
Arguably the greatest test innings of all time. Salute to Mr Stokes.
No t20 can match this
I can't imagine what it was like to be there
What a screamer of a match! And what a redemption for Lyon in 2023! Imagine being him.. then and now!
Pat Cummins took the revenge
Umpiring 🐐
It reminds me of 2019 wc final
I forget how many times I have seen this highlights over the years 😂. It’s just mind blowing.
Australia throws this match......3 of last 3 out missed😂
Mouth watering match
What a match
Re watching it after 2023 Ashes. one of the greatest test match i ve ever seen in my life
Now pat Cummins 🔥third class bowling ever England
mistake of umpire
He has won two World cups for his team and this test match I think equal to any T20 World Cup what a player England has recently produced.
"Some people say: Test match is so boring..
I reply: Have u ever seen the ashes??"
People talk about 2005's Edgbaston test cricket. But I think this 2019's Headingley test is the greatest test match of all time.
Rip those who are thinking test cricket is boaring
The amount of times i keep coming back to this. Pure entertainment
After 4 years australia get the revenge ❤️🙌
Unnecessary review for Leach LBW if the review was not taken they would used it for Stokes
Who is here after Pat Cummins takes the revenge of this match❤
"Who is After Pet Cummings 
Recreated It?"
Might be the best clutch sport performances ever
Who here after pat Cummins partnership 2023 ashes ⚱️😅
Anyone here after England  first Ashes test deafeat at Edgbaston? 2023??
Who is here after Pat Cummins fabulous innings in ashes 2023?
This is an one hell of a test match which gives a lot of hope and joy 😁 😍❤ Thanks and congratulations to ben stokes and his team 👍☺
Thats how Bazball was invented! Ben Stokes you genius.

Who is here after pat cummins revenge??
Anyone here after proper test cricket game in 1st match of ashes 2023🤍
"చాలా grate match..
ఒక ఆస్ట్రేలియా లాంటి పెద్ద జట్టు మీద ఇలాంటి అద్భుతమైన విజయం సాధించడం అంటే మాటలు కాదు..

2019 belonged to Ben stokes ❤️
Gabba pant = headingley stokes
If only Australia had that review 😅
"The greatest ever test match knock in the 4th innings, in my opinion..."
Who' is here after Australia trashed india in WTC finale
High pressure made Diamond
"00:40 Despite what you think of the guy, but imo this Warner catch is one of the greatest of all time. He can’t see it. He dives to where he thinks the ball should be. It’s phenomenal."
No reviews left.... australia lots there
Ben stocks 🙌💎
14:34 Umpires well played for England again after 2019 WC finals
Ben Stokes ... What a player 🤘👑🔥
That's LBW. Cheats
I came here to see the winning celebration ❤ 17:04
The best unbeaten single run of all time by jack leach
🙌
"Australia win by 1 run ,if umpire gave  the right decision 😢"
Chokers Australia 😅😂
The game plan they had was very intensive First 2 days they play Proper test match and next 2 days are odi's and strategy was aggressive nature of England ..feirce
Stokes is lucky man
Great match.. great work ben stokes... but what i could see ...he is really a very lucky man....neither the world cup nor this ashes would have been possible without those multiple lucky moments...
Mark nicholas literally the best commentator around not being invited to  IPL you know why :D to protect pegmaar shastris image of being the best commentator lol
17:13 best capture of this century ❤
Classic test match ever ❤❤❤❤❤
Australia is going to win like this and take revenge tomorrow
Bazzzball
Luck भी उनका साथ देता है जो हार नही मानते
ben stokes❤️🇧🇩
Ben Stock played with a lot of determination and made impossible matches possible and proved that he is a great player. A wonderful match that those who love cricket will surely remember for a long time.
This not Ben stokes.csk player🤪
if cricket ever deserved a pitch invasion...
Greatest match of alll time
"I see first time that Australian fielded like Pakistan, otherwise they have superb fielding side 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😅😅😅😅😅"
That LBW 😅  nd Aus wasted that review
It was written in the stars!!
Still here in 2023 🫠
The crowd noise is so wonderful. What a hero performance.
19:3
Watched it live. What an experience
"14:53 imagine if Umpire made the right decision, all BEN STOKES efforts would've been wasted. But i am Happy that he won that match for ENGLAND!!"
This is a match 🫡
Robbed
"This and the T20 World Cup Final were by far the best sporting exhibitions I’ve ever seen live, and I’m not even much of a Cricket fan."
If nathon lyon was an indian then sure what will happen next few hours after lost that match😮....
"Wonder how half of the spectators didn't faint out of a nervous breakdown. Phew....what a match that was! Sweaty palms, heart pounding, body shivering.....didn't matter if you aren't from England- just a cricket fan being treated to pure gold that we call Test Cricket!"
We have more ben strocks in India but not this one😢
"Poor fielding by Aussies and top
Of that poor umpiring by the West Indian. It was meant to be an English day."
In Stokes we trust..
Rishav pant in Gabba and stoked over here pure destruction
"Wow, what an innings."
I still get a semi watching that reverse sweep for six 4 years later
An inning for ages
This was the beginning of bazball!
RIP lyon😮
Cmon give some credit to johny
He was out
2019  a year remember for Ben stokesss what a man 🥵❤️ the legend of big matches ❤️⚡️
totally looks like fixing
Man of the match award goes to umpire
17:00❤❤
Still the most remarkable game of “red ball” cricket 🏏 that I have ever seen.
"Sorry for Indians fans, but I feel this match was more entertaining & thriller than Gabba 2021."
I'm here after start of the Ashes 2023
That outside leg review cost match more than everything for Australia 🤐
Poor Drs taken by Paine and Cummins
Who is proud to be a ummat Hazrat Muhammad ❤️🕋🕋
"Lbw,  run out chance"
"Incredible luck this player have ❄️
Ben stokes luck on highest peak"
Leach u beauty
❤❤❤❤❤
Watching this 30mins before the first ball of the ashes 2024.
"If it were an IPL game, it would have definitely been termed as ""fixed"" by people looking at the no. of misfields."
"How much luck do you need ?
England: Yes"
Benstokes >>>>>chokli 🤮🤢💩💩💩🤧
In this innings Benjamin Andrew Stokes gave us a lesson that never ever give up in life whatever the situation commits..🙌🙌🙌
One of the best test matches & innings ever. Never get tired or rewatching this one! Stokes is a hero but so is Leach. He's the reason Stokes was even able to finish off the win
What a Match!........
This is beauty of test cricket....❤
Watch 16:59 on 2x speed
That was easyli missing leg stump.. Unnecessarily DRS wasted.. They dont hav DRS when it is needed in last Lyon's over... That was clear out... Umpire mot given... If they kept that DRS review they would hav taken in Lyon's over... And Australia's bad luck that lyon missed simple runout
Watching this at the eve of the ashes hope we see this stokesy back he hasnt been same since the mentak health thing and hope we win it this time
wow😮
But australia best in the world
One bad decision can change your life and a test match...
this is the best test match and border gavasker trophy 2020/21 is the best test series
Stokes superstar ❤❤❤
That's why iam big fan of stokes❤❤❤
Ashes is the greatest

Australia k paas rewieu hone se jit jana tha par pehle khatm kar diya Lyon ne stokes ko lbw kr diya tha
Too much luck for England
Ben stokes 💪
I think it had been decided that England has to win..... Worst umpiring...... How was it possible side like ausies did fielding like Street Boyz.... Lyon straight away missed 2 ezi run outs..... Ohhhhh these scripted matches have made the cricket boring...... I know majority would not like my comment..... But it's the darkest side which can't be revealed easily😂
❤One of the best end bast test match . ❤
I really miss Geoffrey Boycott's commentary.
Aus are 🏆 champions here ...if not the very best ...stokes was clear out
What a summer 2019 was!
I'm watching this in 2023 just because of Ben Stokes.♥️
"What a match, what a inning what a performance, incridble"
Clearly its match fixing😂
17.08
One of the best innings
Greatest match of cricket

Greatest test innings ever truly a remarkable player he  delivers whenever england needs him ❤
What a innings stokes ❤❤❤❤
Englismen Pure love for Test is ❤❤
That was a clearly out Ben stokes 😂
Greatest movement ever in test matches 🔥💓
No disrespect for Stokes but umpire clearly made an unfair call by not giving lbw on that last appeal 😏
This one and the gabba will haunt aussies for ever
Beacuse of worst fielding england win otherwise it is very difficult for england to win
India should have played like England today in wtc'23😭
And then there is india loosing WTC finals bc
Watching this on June11-2023 WTC Final day... This man Ben stokes probably played one of the best innings  on the final day of a test match 🔥world have ever seen
"Shows when both a run out missed and no review left when just 2 runs were left after all this can make you lose, when you could have won a Test match by 1 single run !!!"
The greatest test match of history 🔥🔥🔥
nothing is impossible
This was a movie and Stokes was the hero
Today history repeat wtc
He was out. Australia much deserved this.
ben stokes is one lucky bastard 1st in the odi wc then in the test match fk
"Today india need to pulloff a miracle like this to win the WTC 2023 final, hopefully virat will do it for us."
Ben stokes living legend 👏🏻
this year 2023 ashes win england
we want this kind of inning from indian batsman to win WTC final.
17:00 one of the best scene in the cricket history
Get ready to today aus vs ind wtc match..❤ this innings will repeat today. ..
"I know the result already...
But everytime I watch it I get goosebumps 🫨🫨"
Wondering what if Australia did not waste their review on outside pitching delivery
Beauty of cricket lies in the Whites.
Still giving goosebumps ❤
Kohli needs this innings to win wtc 23
The only reason I'd ever have children is to one day tell my grandchildren that I watched this live.
Warner and Smith probably cried after this
Australia ne 2 catch chod de Ben stokes ke
Blind Joel Wilson
Pls sir jadeja played that historic innings for INDIAN tomorrow ❤️❤️
Ben Stokes  onen man Army 💪
Joel Wilson the culprit
14:53 feeling bad for Australia
17:00 legendary moment
The GOAT Forever- Stokes 🔥
What joe wilson had done..
"I AM INDIAN BUT I LOVE THIS MATCH VERY MUCH.
FORTUNATELY I WATCHED THIS MATCH LIVE. 
I WAS SUPPORTING ENGLAND.
BEN STOKES PLAYED A BLINDER.
WHENEVER IWANT TO WATCH THIS MATCH, I JUST TYPE BEN STOKES HEROICS AND I WILL GET THIS INCREDIBLE INNINGS OF BEN STOKES.
SUPER MATCH SUPER INNINGS BY BEN STOKES."
nice innings but too many lucks. umpire gave wrong decisom of lbw two times
"Clearly,The Match Was Fixed😢"
"The moment 20/20 play collided with Test Match cricket. 

Awesome. Magnificent. Breathtaking even when viewed years on but probably the beginning of the end of Test Cricket too."
He is a legend . Deserves a knighthood .
Bestest rivalry 💪
17:04 Cinematic .... but not scripted 🔥🔥  Goosebumps for every Cricket fan 🤍
"I still remember watching this on the Tele very late in Melbourne, I’m sure it was well passed midnight; it was a stunning performance, no question the Leeds crowd willed on Stokes and England, such a great innings, he absorbed a lot of good bowling early on and then absolutely pounded the ball around"
"Love you Stokes🤩🤩
From that day,
Your bating was so good!! Awesome🔥"
thanks to ashes due to this test cricket is still interesting
Each time I watch this YouTube manage to poke in a few more ads!
Australia wasted the review.If they had one they would have won by 1 run.
Who is in 2023?? 🔥🔥🔥
Match winner always
What a player ❤❤
Im happy to feel test match celebrating like in 90s but àctually Australia won it they don't have reviews
Bad luck for Aussies fielding 😅
Like Virat and Dhoni to India.... Ben Stokes to England.... under pressure match winning knock
a great fielder like Lyon missing the run-out...that's what nerves can do to you...
Match to remember for ages
"After losing 9 wicket Ben Stoke went for slog and this was the right decision ""Fortune favors the Brave"""
I think I watched this match 10th time😌😌
"I've been to this stadium today with my uncles to watch Yorkshire vs Derbyshire in the Vitality T20 Blast! It is an awesome experience man as we saw many famous cricketers like Dawid Malan, David Wiese, Shan Masood, Zaman Khan and Haider Ali! Will never forget this day! "
Good man
Happy birthday ben stokes 🙏🏻🎂❤️
Biggest And Loudest Crowd Reaction Ever in Cricket History 😱🤯🥵🔥🙌🏻

Innings of a lifetime.. Ben u r 💎💎💎💎💎💎❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Aussie fans disregard this cuz they won the series but we all got to watch the aus team being forced to watched this the next Day
Stokehas nothing to loose....
Man of the match should be Joe Wilson....
I feel sorry for those guys who think test match are boring 🪴
An inning that keeps the ashes alive...
The unwanted review waste by Australian captain
"If jeo Wilson had given out, Australia would have won the game"
A thriller more then hichkouk movie
What a clutch player he really is. One of the major factors for England’s maiden victories in ODI World Cup 2019 and T20 World Cup 2022.
"GOAT MATCHES I HAVE SEEN IN CRICKET
TEST -ENG VS AUS (ASHES) 
ODI- ENG VS NZ (ICC WC 2019) 
T20- ENG VS WI (ICC WC T20 2016)
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 is common🐐🐐"
"This inning is a true representation of the word ""one man army"""
"14:02 he dropped the ashes , great est match of all time"
Australia played like Bangladesh in the end…
That's why it's called Test Cricket. Where heroes become immortal.
Man of the match Joel Wilson
"The greatest 1 run ever.... 
One of the best 👍💯test match ever played... This is real.. Goosebumps
Like one of the greatest fifa world final ever played 2022"
I have played 100s of similar Innings in my dreams but This man Plays It everytime The team needed 🔥🔥
New zealanders always beat Australians  too hard

Fair play to the Aus team very sporting to shake hands and say well played
13:25 why they review this
I watch this vedio more than 10 times 😈
Australia will remember this Ben Stokes .....😅
"Karma..
Nathon Lyon fake runout for butter nd in end jack leach , Lyon cannot collect the ball"
A wasted review and then a wrong decision? This match was fixed.
Ben ❤️
Stokes --->owner of Australian bowling
Best test match
Crying. Legit Crying. We love Stokes in India here ❤❤ and Leach did sooooo WELL ❤❤❤
But it should have been Australia's victory.......that lbw should have been given(No offence for stokes knock it was amazing)
Only test cricket is to expose the complete player he is complete player and that winning pose is just iconic
BEN STOKES PUNCHING AND AUDIENCE ROARING IN BACKGROUND IS THE GTREATEST SCENE...IT'S LIKE  A GENERAL HAS BOOSTED MORALE OF  HIS ARMY INTO THE BATTLE
14:36 well fixed
Ufff❤
Beautiful Stokes love it🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
england has always been favoured ..they did not deserve to win this match nor they deserved to win world cup ..
"This was one of those matches when it feels like it's T20
Stokes killed it!"
15:22 that was the moment🎉
17:04 gives us goosebumps 😎😎😎
"This match i saw when regular wicket fall.Suddenly Stoke stand behind the wicket and Start counter attack, uff this moment don.t forget❤❤🎉"
What an amazing game. Well done England. Australia missed some chances and England took theirs. Better on the day.
"Why did the English team didn't come running to congratulate stokes.
I was thrilled. How couldn't they be😂"
A moment of Science for those that think test matches are boring
"crazy that if aus didnt waste that review they could've won, by one run"
Actually Australia Is The Winner of This Game If They Had A Review 😑😑😑
No matter which country you are from.. if you love the game.. this is one of the greatest knock of all time
Benn Stokes is best❤
"From getting six 5 sixes in a row to becoming a match winner, Ben Stokes has come a long long way . I think he is one of the all rounders in the world only after sir Ravindra Jadeja"
Bro took the helmet shot too seriois
Such a great match every moment was more and more interested
Ben stokes God gifted man love you man❤❤❤
He play the best cricket ever but unfortunately he was out
"Ben Stokes gets hit on the helmet = fine.

Philip Hughes gets hit on the helmet = dies.

Brits just stronger"
Ben stokes is has win mostly match with 9 wicket
⚡
"Joe Wilson won the match for England.
If an umpire couldn't give that LBW decision, then he ain't fit to do umpiring at all."
"I think,Ben Stokes is the motivation player jo kavibi haar maanta nahi....this is the all time memorable match....."
2nd man of the match should go to the umpire
Ben Stokes Hits Six Crowd Cheering & Mark Nicolas Making Everything Perfect. Greatest Test Match Ever.!
"15:18 
Here we go scores are level"
Nice
another ashes please ....... the voice from kunaal raaj ...........
Greatest inning of all time❤
"I listened to this live while driving to the west country in the uk with my wife in the passenger seat. She has little interest in cricket, so she couldn't understand my emotions at the time. The missed runout close to the end was strength-sapping!! Small margins indeed."
"2 Australia mistakes:
1. Outside leg review very unnecesary
2. runout 
and finally umpire mistake of clean lbw not out"
Lets scrap test matches?
Clearly Australia Win If They Don't Wast That Fu*king Review 🤐
....for anyone who says cricket is boring....
Bazball before Baz!
Amazing match and amazing fours and sixes by Ben Stokes
🙌🏻✨💥
They needed that review they needed that review
Mark nicholls is a remarkable commentator
ONE OF THE GREATEST INNINGS OF ALL TIME
"No doubt ben stocks play well. Bad luck of australia for this match. They miss so many chances . Last simple run out missed 😅. LBW is out but they lost review on previous over. Too much luck on England side . Too many sixes of ben stocks too close of bundries and fielders. 
POV = kismat me haarna likha tha aus ke 😂😂😂"
This video never ever get old... Never
"I never seen a test match like this...
This one of the greatest test match ever I saw In my life Everly sure.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
Ben Stokes is living legend
I am Indian. And I certainly accept that from 2015 and onwards England Cricket team is the most entertaining team to watch the game of cricket incredible records incredible matches incredible finishes and moments. Certainly the inventors of the game are now in the driving seat and have completely revolutionized the game of cricket 🖖
Ben stoke king
One of the best all-rounders of all time.
"If not for horrible umpiring from Joel Wilson...
 That said australia dropped many chances."
Ben Stokes a real hero🙌🙌
He was clearly out...
These types of tests make test cricket better and nail biting than any other format
"with all due respect to this Stokes innings, Australia made some puzzling decisions like the forced review of a  Cummins lbw shout. Tim paine is not a good captain under even some pressure."
"maradona had hand of god but 
STOKES had  bat of god in this match 

god was against australia ..."
"The one player who shook all 11 players.
An unimaginable game.
Only One BENJAMIN STOKES 🔥🔥🔥"
ECB and BCCI are dishonest cricket board.
Now he is headly to chennai
"Every time I watch I get goosebumps!!!!
My fav Ben stokes 🏏.."
The commentry is high level reminded me Ravi Shastri s commentry
"This match can make anyone in the world, the Fan of this Format😍😍"

Still waching 2023
Never Give Up 👍👍👍👍👍👍
All time motivation match never ever give up ❤❤
My favorite video on YouTube
"Ben Stokes was a toss for NOT embracing Leach at the moment of victory...!
Says alot about who and what he is!"
"England did cheat, Joel Wilson is a Joke. One of the Worst, Umpire I'd ever seen in Cricket history"
England had given 4 chances by god.
Cricket haters have to see

Incredible Ben Stokes!! Incredible English cricket!!
By far one of the best test match
Aus is win the match but umpire not fair
Hands down!!! One of the greatest match of all time
Bad decision by umpire
Ben Stokes 🔥❤️🇧🇩🇧🇩
The match the greatest test alongside kusal perera’s against South Africa prove there is no such thing as luck. Your hard work and decision making creates luck for you it’s not decided by any upper power or pray.

Thank you for making this video
The ashes will always be better than overrated india-pakistan rivalry....

"Still I can't believe.....
But it happened...."
17:04 star sports would have put advertisement . This is why I watch ECB or Fox or channel 9 where they capture raw emotions than the Kent RO advertisements
I saw this last shot on Instagram when Ben stokes showed his aggression than I saw him here
"Stroks braked the attitude of ausis team.
This match is just like rebbit and tortoise  story. 😄😄"
"As always england were lucky. 
Missed runout by Lyon, lbw call by Wilson, poor decision to take review by Paine."
jadeja the goat
One of the greatest contribution from 11 in crucial match... seriously 💯
If they didn't wasted a review before ....they would have won !!!
What a match 😲

The crowd screaming yeahhhhhh! Just give chills 😎
"From 2016 T20 WC final to 2019 WC final , Headingley 2019 & 2022 T20 WC final ..... He changed the history of English cricket"
"All , time greatest test innings 
Kusal janith perera' s  innings (durban miracale)"
England will forever be grateful to Nathan Lyon and umpire Joel wilson
I love how ben stokes stands up whenever England needs him
This is wonderful innings by ben stokes i seen ever.
I love how Stokes bided his time in this innings until going into full viking beserker mode when the 9th wicket fell.
Joel wilson's decision
After Gabba match....this match stands 2nd best test match ever in the history.....wat a match.......
"You could never write a better script than that

Left handers in test cricket= Game Changer ✨🤟🥵❣️
One of the best Test match I have ever seen....🔥🔥
"The innings showed how immature was Tim Paine as a captain! I wouldn’t have wasted my review.
He is not a true Aussie player, a true Aussie player believes till the last moment to win the match."
First time nathen Lyon and second time jowilsun save the match for englend absolutely guttet mement for cricket Australia 😅🙁
Jack leach too had an important role to not to get out and play properly with concentration

This indeed is the best Test innings ever played
Not gonna lie this really stung!! But hats off to Ben Stokes.
Leach should be the man of the match wooow
"Eng vs aus, this match>Gabba test win???"
Watching the heroics of stokes nth times obsessed ❤
"""Jack leach you're my hero😎,  the Greatest of All time""."
17:05 🔥🔥❤❤
Who is here after csk bought stokes in ipl auction💥
England crowd is the best
The greatest English all-rounder after Ian Botham and Andrew Flintoff. He is none other than Ben Stokes. 🔥🔥
"Hats off for Ben Stokes 👑⛑👒🎩
But the real pressure is on Jack Leach 
What a win for England🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿"
"Luck follows when you determined, disciplined and consistent"
Leach is unsung hero in this match
Really it was AUS who could have easily won the Ashes ! They let chances flew away tbh 💀
14:00 WTF did Nathan Lyon do 💀
Always be my best match i have ever watched
Goosebumps guaranteed 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jack leach scored around 90 runs against Ireland a couple of days before this test was played
Why not to waste drs
"11:40 - That sound of the crowd 
             Just love it
14:01 - Everyone hit the crouch button in the field😂🤣 


Bairstrow and Root attacked early and Archer and Leach backed up 
Don't forgot to give them the credit"
Am i the only one who heard the sound of 'pakad' at 6:34. Question is ki ye bola kisne
14:34 UMPIRES DECISION
It was literally one of the best test ever existed
Greatest test match ever!!!!!
Wow❤
one of great match ❤❤❤
"Don't care about his private life, as a massive England fan I vote the Aussie skipper as the finest PR rep for the Aussies since Sir Les."
15:00        15:19
17:04 I am not an english but this gave me goosebumps 😬
Lesson to learn : Never ever waste your review in desperation...Aus lost the review on the delivery that was clearly pitched outside.
Test match very good game because every player stronly play and try best on filed 👍💯
What a match Ben stokes 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
every cricket player are prince in England
15:26 is the greatest show in this highlights
Any 2023 here
"15:11
'Jack leach you're my hero '"
It’s really Australian’s game…great stood by strokes and leech…fate wins
It is the best test match in test match history
This is the real test match ...not those who were end in 3 days
RIP on umpire...lbw out बेन स्टोक्स
Why umpire not given out for lbw at lyon over at the end.
"Saw the highlights for all 5 days. And one thing for sure, the umpiring errors were a lot. And at last player was out, umpiring error costed them a match.

Lucky England - 2019 world cup, 2019 Ashes match."
A left hand all rounder brought major trophies for india and england...yuvi and stokes💯♥️⚡
"14:01..watch the Australian captain,sleep fielder and all aus fielder even umpire 😂how a run out excitement turned into something 🤩"
Luck always favour him
"Bcoz of 2 reasons australia lost 
1. Wasting their last review 
2. Missed runout out of leach 
But what a player ben stokes 
Hats off👑"
"No one is talking about that umpire's decision.
Man of the Match for England😅"
17:08 Cameraman god mode!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Real cricket is test cricket
Clearly missed chances by umpires and Australia.
That God was so happy with ben stokes but what a knock 🔥🥵
One of the greatest innings in the history of test cricket!!!
"The last wicket would have fallen
-If the catch wasn't dropped
-If runout wasn't missed
-If LBW was given out
All of these didn't happen because the match pressure peaked at that period and the only factor that brought all of these in favour of England was the support from their Fans!
It shows how important moral support is

Greatest Chase of the Ashes!"
Some people are born to change the game
This is what cricket is❤️
"Had Tim Paine not took that silly DRS before , Ben Stokes was out there ....In fact all was going in his( Ben) way ...He deserves that win ❤️... The Greatest all rounder of all time .. He played like a Warrior"
Behengg Stokessss......
Stokes King
What a Match.......
Umpire won the match
Umpire mistake fielding not good
"I love also test cricket,,,, Between Eng vs Aus,Aus vs Ind,Ind vs Eng."
But that was clear out
Welcome to csk ben stokes
Legend🔥🔥
LYON HAS FUMBLED
"In these 2 years 2019 & 2021 Only one man who sacked a match single handedly from Aussies mouth in 2019 there is Beb stokes🔥In 2021 There is Rishabh pant!! ""Toota hai gabba ka ghamand""!"
what a mtch.
What a match 🔥
12:17 Catchdrop 🤡🤡 2 Catchdrop + Out But Review Not Left Umpire Stupid Decision 💩💩
Taste of TEST💖
Greatest Winnings One Man Army 👑
Best test match I've ever seen in my life 🔥🔥🔥
"didn't raise his bat on 100 and celebrated the win and gone bonkers 
we were not ready for this innings"
Thnks stoksy
"Forever one of the greatest innings ever played. To hold his composure after running out the last recognised batsmen in the team, to carry the team to victory on his back with ""the greatest 1 of all time"" down the other end. I don't care what country he plays for. This was one of the greatest innings I ever saw played....... and I'm an Aussie for reference."
"""The greatest 1 of all time"""
Ben Stokes is the Sportsman GOAT of the whole United Kingdom. A True warrior and a winner.
The greatest test innings ever played. Just addicted to it. 🔥🔥🔥
ben stokes you beuaty
Australia  had ruined their chances by that review
Greatest test match innings i had ever seen🔥Ben Stokes❤️🔥
Willson's bravest decision that took the ashes to England feeling sad for Lyon 🤣
"Man of the match
Jack Leavh fr"
0:39 Warner catch oh god I'm sweating 😅
Super king Stokes 💛😎🔥
"Whenever I feel demotivated, I watch this inning of Stokes.
""Jack Leach you are my hero! 
The greatest 1* of all time""
Very well said."
"an excellent example of ""fortune favors the bold."""
Scintillating.
Man of the match award goes to umpire
Stokes ⚡
"But they became uncomfortable with Bairstow, the evidence is apparent( all wicketkeeper batsman can bat) Bairstow, also
 ❤"
Lone warrior destroy australia single handly Banjemin Andrew stokes
Stupidest review taken by Paine
Test cricket is amazing when it's in 18min form.
That last moment run out chance reminded of Alan Donald Lance klusner in 99 wc semifinals
I come here for motivation
"Can't watch that enough, what a great game."
"Watching it for 100th time ❤️
Nothing but emotions 🥺"
"Ben, welcome to csk!"
Uffffffff💥💥💥💥💫💫
MOTM Joel Willson 😶
"Incredible batting by Stokes, but it was the idiotic Shane Watson-tier review at 13:03 that cost Australia this match. If they'd been able to review the Stokes lbw shout a couple of overs later, they'd have won the game. Instead, they spuriously wasted their last review on a ball that even a blind person could tell pitched outside leg. All the talk was about the absolutely amazing innings from Stokes, Leach's gritty no.11 performance, and the sheer schoolboy choke of a straightforward runout chance by Lyon in the penultimate over... but if Australia hadn't spurned that last review they'd have won the test by a run. Fine margins, this game.

What an innings, though."
"Imagine if England had lost this match and wc final, people would've said Stokes deserved the win. Bcoz Stokes won the matches, people saying it's not fair. Perspective!"
Dramatic match of all time stokes wold have been out if umpiring have been good and the if Aussies would have ayed up to their 100%
100% fixed match
"Hell of a innings OMG .
Definition of CRICKET ❤️🔥"
Bhai majha aagya hai
"The last hour of play was as dramatic as any sporting event ever! Dropped catches, desperation review which was so costly as Lyon had Stokes out LBW late! Simply amazing! Stokes throwing caution to the wind was hilariously insane! Loved every shot!!!!

Thank you to both teams for the spectacle 🤝"
This was the game Tim Paine should’ve been sacked as captain. Wasted a review in the previous over when it was down the leg. Lost the match single-handedly.
unbleable switch hit
The more the pressure is the more he will play his best cricket.
"Who do women think they have to shout when commentating cricket? Maybe in football or horse racing, but not cricket. It's jarring."
And they still lost the series lol
14:06 Deathstare 🗿☠️👽
"Shane Warne's ball of the century
Jack Leach's run of the century"
This is the man who doing again and again  a true fighter like yuvi
Nothing better than doing it to the Aussies. Listened to it on a laptop in Spain. What a memory.
The name Ben Stokes😎
Greatest of all time
"The greatest test of all time

Magnificent from England. Stokes brilliant. Brilliant backing up by Leach. Australia need a new fielding coach.
CSK  fan's 💥🔥🔥🔥
क्रिकेट के इतिहास में इस टेस्ट मैच को हमेशा याद रखा जाएगा
England team change the pattern of test cricket
Aussies one wasted review away from the win
11:19 he's not even celebrating his 100!! It shows how much he's dedicated towards his team victory🤌
Aus team give so many life's of Ben Stokes they are drops some catches and very poor umpiring otherwise aus can win easily this match don't forget it🙌
Big match player
Ben Stokes fan attendence here
When England play test then its not boring
"2 missed chances... 1 not given out.... Hard luck but Stokes the man!

borhia
The Greatest match i have ever seen

Csk 💪
"But, really best team is australia. Umpire don't gave Lyon's OUT. Remember that."
my god
Of that time pain not take a review
Stokes is out by Nathan Lyon 😂
I love how the commentary became more and more hysterical the closer we got to the target🤣
I'm always lucky to have this match last day highlights in the recommended section of my YouTube repeatedly.
"Run out miss
Catch drop 
Umpire didn’t give the last appeal out… lucky win"
"Cricket at its very best! 
Ben Stokes you beauty!"
Welcome CSK monster

Greatest innings of all time
Goona tell my kids I have witnessed the Greatest test of all time!!!
Greatest Test Match of All Time 🏏🔥🔥😍❤❤ Well Done Ben STOKES 🛐🛐
Greatest Test match Innings of all time
"Ben Stokes has returned a fire to England, along with class and sportsmanship. His team conduct themselves with grace and manners, and are a joy to watch and learn from. This is how it should be done. The Ashes are going to be quite something. Ali V Frazier. I just hope England are Ali!"
"I am an avid England fan but this test showed  sportsmanship at its best . I know he has had his subsequent trivails but Tim Paine is held in the highest regards here and lyons is a hero for the way he conducted himself  a clear lbw ""out"" decision but no more reviews .  Can't wait for next summer. We will either batter the Aussies or, begrudgingly, applaud them."
Wow 🙄🙄🙄🙄
"This ining of BENJAMIN ANDREW STOKES can surely inspire many young lads to play cricket, to play test cricket. Absolute legend of the game."

Ben stokes didn’t raise his bat for century. Meaning doesn’t care as long as the win matters.
"India and pakistan are not true cricket lovers nation, they are just extremists kind of, but England and australia have such decent and lovely crowd in the world, that tells how they love even test matches"
If this match was played between pakistan and other countries than sure this match gone under the cross checked due to poor fielding
I watched this match live omg what a match it was.
What a match man!!!
The best all-rounder of this era greats 👑
"And now he conquers Pakistan
Stokessy 😍😍"
Umpire ne out nahi diya clear lbw tha stokes
Kismat ho toh Ben stokes jaisi ho
Tell me test cricket is boring and you are already killed by me
"Because of Ben stokes....England won the 2019 world, then won the ashes in 2019, and now won the 2022 t20 world cup. Goat 🐐 Of all  time. What a gem 💎 player he is ....❤️❤️❤️"
The missed run out and the lbw w/o the review available cuts deep
The single greatest innings of all time... Stokes is a GENIUS!!!
Joel Wilson bro 😂😂😂
HAT’S OF TO BEN STOKES
Thriller ⚡
Umpire be like.. England ko jeetane me mera contribution Stokes Se zayada hai... 😂😂🤣🤣

"When you look back here and at that World Cup Final, they were glimpses of what was to come in the McCullum era."
Amazing from Stokes and good support for him from tail enders
Poor umpiring
Ben stokes crisis man for England cricket team. Any format he plays its  threatening for opposition. Ben stokes is a motivation.🙏🙏
Fortune favours the brave.

Best part starts from 8:55
Controversial yet again.look at the lbw appeal especially at the crunch moment

"lyon slips and unnecssary review cost them match, brilliant stokes as always."
Best innings of all time
goosebumps
Cheering evry run
"Idiots say: India won the world cup because of Dhoni because he played so well and single-handedly made his team win the final against Sri Lanka. 

Legends say: England won this 3rd test because of Strokes because he actually made his team win this match single-handedly.

We ain't the same, bruh!"
Tim Paine shouldn't have wasted that review.
This was better than T20 .What a match
"English cricket team's story in recent times, stokes absorbs pressure, stokes gets lucky and stokes hits the winning runs"
Absolutely incredible 😱😱😱
"Australia Win the Match 👍
Umpire ☕☕☕"
"Hence Proved children, Test Matches are not boring🗿"
"If Harris, can't catch. He is not real Cricketer"
Nathan Lyon Made aus lose 😂
Greatest Test match i've ever seen..😵😵❤❤🔥🔥
I think poor umpiring cost Australia a match
30% credit goes to leach
Always talk about Australian team but not talk this England team what a comeback team ❤️❤️🏏🏏👑👑🤟🤟
A player of big matches
"Umpire wrong decision ,,,Eng win"
Poor descision by umpire
"Ager Ksi cheese ko shiddat se chaho to sare kainat use tum se milane se ljj jaati hai ❤❤

Umpire is mad giving wrong decisions and match fixing was definately
Win by umpire.
Win by umpire.
England got lucky
Also miss runout
Bad umpire call
Great stokes
"I'm an Indian but I always love to writing about true criketer &fans
After watching this video everyone should talk only about, it's victory not only England's but also cricket

It's a game of full of emotions"
Hindustan ke log yahan bhi apne maa ki gaand marate hai 😀😀
Umpire mistake lbw out 🙊🙊🙊
i dont blame lyon man he did a LBW but stupid umpiring led to this.
Who is here after T20 world cup final England victory because of benstokes inning of 52 run
"Who is here after T20 World Cup 2022
Ben stokes everywhere 🔥🔥"
💗
Wait did the umpire just straight up wrongly not give the out and therefore caused England to win???
"this inning was an absolute masterclass, in my opinion it was better than the world cup knock if we do not consider the stakes"
Lyon 👍🏻🙄
"Just unbelievable!  
So many sixes to finish off the game.  If he went for fours they'd be mostly cut off and then it'd only be a single, and then it would be Leach on strike for the rest of the over.  They rotated the strike well on the 5th or 6th ball of the over - that's why Leach was so keen on that single that should have been run out.

So Stokes gambled on smashing them all the way over the top.  One got close to a superb dive from Warner, and one was dropped during a dive from Harris, but the others were long enough to carry.  He tried the reverse sweep and the ramp shot early on, but as the scoreboard counted down he went for conventional lower risk shots."
Fix match
"""Ben Stokes with the winning runs. Who else? It is always Ben Stokes with the winning runs.""
  Naser Hussain❤️"
Just wow 😳. Best cricket ever. Just amazing 😍
"Who's here in nov 2022
Forever Ben stokes a hero"
What an incredible innings❤
"The no.of catches dropped, the reviews wasted and the run out miss shows the amount of pressure Stokes has mounted on Aussies"
Benjamin stokes the fighter
🔥 Remember The Name Ben Stokes 🔥
The best test match I've ever watched. It was crazy watching it live. Couldn't believe he done it. The level of suspense when Leech was facing the ball was outrageous.
3yrs been! What an inspiring performance 🙌🏼stokes❤✨
Ben Stokes 🥰🥰
"What a twist an horror , thriller.. mind-blowing it's not England win it's a cricket win on that day proud of me cricket fan"
Australian feild made many mistakes
"Ben stokes uh did it in WC final 2019 
T20 WC final 2022 
Big match player 💥💥"
More interesting than t20 matchs ✨
Never waste review 😂😂. It was clearly pitching outside leg and still Tim Paine wasted it. Later Stokes was out and then Aus had no review left.
Absolute example of fate
And our blind Indian fan kids compare him to Pandya 😂
"Nasir Hussain mentioned this match after Stokes scored the winning runs against Pakistan in T20 World Cup final. Now I’m watching the Highlights of this magnificent innings by a fabulous player. 
Love this player from Pakistan 🇵🇰"

"I know, You are Not here for the First Time"
4:11 I am not sure what Warner is doing.
"one of the greatest matches of all time 
ben stokes"
One of the greatest match in the world test cricket...
"Reliving the agony and a great innings from Leach (and Stokes).  Great test matches are the best, even when we lose."
"Brian Lara’s 153 was better. But only by a very very small margin. This was masterful in so many ways. The strike retention, the mighty sixes, the number of runs left to get with  the last wicket in play. …. Amazing drama. The only reason I put Lara above this is the quality of the attack of the opposition."
"If someone says Test cricket are boring
Show them this match
If someone says Test cricket are interesting 
Then you have 10000+matches to show"
"If someone says Test cricket are boring
Show them this match
If someone says Test cricket are interesting 
Then you have 10000+matches to show"
"Ive watched this innings so many times, and every time, think, Bugger, we have lost this !! so many twists, turns and a tad lucky, but Ben Stokes, and have to mention Leach, what a come back, quite incredible"
Stokes... what a LEGEND!!!!
This is the one of the finest match that I have ever seen in test cricket.
Stokes was clearly out when 2 runs needed to win but umpire goes other way
Kohli innings against Pakistan in t20 World Cup 2022 and this test match innings by Ben stokes are the greatest innings I had seen. I’m lucky to witness kohli innings live at MCG.
One man army
"Watching this before ind-eng wc22 epic semi finals clash 🥵🥶
ben stokes biggest threat"
Umpire mistake. Austalia is the winners
The umpire should have given the LBW right in the end.
David malan not getting batting in t20wc 2022 even he was in linup at3 so why ECB playing him in team.. Such a waste
Australian players often cheat😂😂😂and thats fact
Never gets old 🔥🔥❤️❤️
I considered aus as the winners eng can't win without bad decisions of empires and stupid rules
Reckon that’s up there with Lara’s 153
The Greatest test match in decade
Let's be honest. This is not the first time we are here. It gives sheer motivation to say the least❤❤
I love u Ben stokes
"There should be a documentary, OH THERE NOW IS ;-)  Ben From when he enters, fans that were there, commentators and so on. As so much happens in one innings, more than some entire tests"
Great Britain
Hands down a Cricket match can not be peaked more than that.....
GOAT
Ben stokes di ben stokes ne
Still increases my heartbeat 💓
"One was Sachin's inning against Pakistan in 1999 Test and then this one. As spectators, you can't watch it."
14:34 what a shame.
Not better than India vs Pakistan
15:23
Test matches are boring sometimes but not THE ASHES
Best test match
"Everyone Talking about Ben Stokes 135*
No one talking about how Jack Leach scored a 1 and faced 17 balls. Imagine if Jack Leach got out then Australia won this match. As an no:11 player, he stayed for 17 balls."
Never underestimate ur opponent
Leach well defended his wicket
That single by leach ✌️
Butelar ran out nahi tha
It is not first time You are watching video... 😇
Respect 🤯🛐
"Clear LBW of Lyon!
Poor umpiring!"
Most incredible crickets fans are engenders. ❤
Ashes is simply cricket at its best.
My favorite ever
14.01- ohhhhh drop it nathon lyon is drop it..flow as a beat
catch drop match drop
And here we are Again 😀
Test is the best format of cricket... It's the real test of a cricketer
Fix by aus
ben stockes omg
Absolutely unreal from Stokes
Ben stokes is a great example of never give up
Unlucky Australia 🦘
one of the best inning after Ian Botham1981
The respect shown at the end is the best bit for me! Aus and uk are bonded .. love it or hate it ! 🇬🇧🇦🇺
Best knock by Ben stokes ❤️
What a commentary
"Is it just me or was Jos butler was given out wrongly. 05:32 , it seemed like Lyon never collected the ball properly"
What a spectacular game!!! Ben nailed it…!
PRIME BEN STOKES 🙌
"Aussie here. I will never forget watching this with one of my best mates at the Dolphin Inn in Meer Ghat by the Ganga in Varanasi, India. Truly the most extraordinary thing I’ve seen on a cricket field."
build a statue ffs!
best performance in-cricket full stop. totally ridiculous. i could watch this every day for the rest of my life and never get bored. different level cricket. wow!
"Many more best innings comes from present, past, and future but this knock is

Amazing knock
Ben Stokes is the best alrounder i have ever seen
Nice mach for cricket history

"When stokes hit the last one 
I get goosebumps 🥺"
England is nice team in the world
Rip for all who thinks test match is boring ❤️
What a play from stokes
Test Cricket♥️
It’s 2022 and I am still wondering why did tim take that review of Cummins ball. 🙃
England win by cheating in the second last over when Australia appeal for lbw it was out in reality but Joe wilson do cheating and give not out it was fixing for sure.the real winner of ashes  is Australia🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺. Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰
I would blame Nathon Lyon and Joel Wilson For Aus Loss 🤣😂
"I never tire of watching this again, as one of the 20 million who were there on the day."
This is what happens if t20 player plays test match
All those who think odi and test are boring  then please see this match and wc 2019 finals
Umpire make win Match fir England 14:50
"Ben Stokes have been part history’s all time best events of cricket - both in WC final victory and Ashes .. In both of these cases, he single handedly pulled things off !!
However in both occasions he had help from either luck playing in his favour or umpires .. they were not as clean as he would probably hope for even though results were achieved !!"
Luck for England
What a match 🔥
What a match!
Careless umpire ! It was fully Australia's game 😑
That's the one of the best test matches in history of this game 👏
One of the best innings ever I have witnessed in my entire life
I'm not a cricket fan but I'm a sports fan and this is the ultimate
Wow 🥺😳
"From 17.05 to 17.12 goosebumps
Salute to the cameraman"
historical innings i have ever seen
That wrong decision by umpire in the end has ruined the win.
It's all about emotion
Stokes was out I mean. The LBW was legit😂 but what a match. test match so intriguing ❤️
Leaving a comment here to tell my grandchildren that I watched this match live on TV.
Best moment that Pattinson ball 😂😂😂
He got his hundred and didn’t celebrate his focus was on the win what a fuckin bloke beat I’ve ever witnessed
The greatest innings of all time by a mile
That was really incredible match well Australia missed many chances to win at last they took review at wrong time they could win but the luck was with england
Hates off to Jack Leech
🤔🤔🤔🤔
Anyone remember Ian Botham story same like this test match. Same like stokes
"Now tats karma for aussies,,,,last 1 wicket they coudnt take,,,you know on that evening lords reported too much plates and glass shattering on the floor"
"Has nobody noticed Australia blatantly cheating?  At about 5:25, when Joss Butler is supposedly run out, Lyons failed to catch the ball, before knocking off the bails with his hands!  Why did nobody see this...including those commentating?"
Ben baba ❤️
"Oh ,this test cricket ❤️"
"Jack Leach : The Unsong Hero of the match.
🙌🙌🙌🙌"
"Despite of Ben stokes 's masterpiece innings , How many of you think this match is fixed ?"
Ben stokes added one more episode to ea sports ashes game
My favourite 🥰❤️🥰🥰❤️🥰❤️

What a Match! Incredible Ben Stokes
Commentators wow
In reality Australia won 🤗
"All time best 🔥 match, ""ben stokes"" remember the name"
Unbelievable
Ok
"I never thought Botham’s heroic 149* at Headingley 1981 could ever be surpassed as a test-match winning performance, but there’s no doubt this is better. Just extraordinary."
BEN  the motherfucking  STOKES . what a match! what a player!
Lbw not out decesion 😂😂😂😂
Ben Stokes in 2019 Hero Mode
What a player in the world cricket
First Ian botham & now ben stokes......... speechless completely
He ascended that day. On a different level. Went super saiyan.
When Superman goes to bed he wears Ben Stokes pyjamas
That’s the best innings I’ve ever seen.
Never get bored to watch this match again and again because of Ben stokes 🔥❤ Jack Leach
Pause it at 16.37. I want that as my wallpaper 🤣🤣
"Goosebumps 🫀.


Whenever, I feel low , I come here.

Btw today England has won Against SA. 2nd test. Day 3. 27 August 2022 ( BenStokes has got his first century as Captain plus he bowled really well, took some crucial wickets)"
Man of the match ben stokes 135 not out excellent innings
Mate Hussains commentary “and it’s down to that man Ben stokes” give me goosebumps like very few things
Commentater says the greatest one of all time Ben stokes
What a test !
The Best innings ever! Nothing beats it!
Mark Nicholas is an underrated commentator.
Biggest lesson for aussies never take things for granted

The way England team playing in the last 5 years... Is also one of the reason luck is favouring them 🔥🔥 an Absolute thriller of a game. Love ❤️ Test Cricket
Stoksy 💓
I personally feel that Jofra's innning  played a vital role in England win
Take a bow 🙇‍♀️ Ben
Superov match bro

People before pandemic
This was the biggest fix of all time.
A1
Nice betting
This watch has changed the test cricket
Ben stok best
Man... gonna miss this legend so much
I don't think you take retirement early
Happy retirement my hero
Australia ke muh se jeet cheen le gaye  Ben stox
"That's why Ben stokes was dangerous,is dangerous,will dangerous 💯💯"
Stokes reverses swip 😍😍😍
"After umpire wrong decision Australia be like: 1 hi second me jindagi badal diya, jajbaat badal diya 🤣"
So sad for aussies👍👍
2019 year produced two great last wicket chases in test match history. The heroes are Kusal perera and  Ben stokes. Unsung heroes are Fernando (11th) and Joe Willson(ump)
Felt so BAD for Nathon Lyon :(.
We can say 13:55 just changed game 🔥
There should be 3rd empire for every appeal that look close
What ahh match england lengent team
"Thank you Tim Paine for wasting the review, and Nathan Lyon for missing  the runout or else without the win, this innings would not be remembered as one of the greatest ever."
Greatest Test match innings ever. Ever.
One of greatest test match ever
Legend Stokes 👍👑👑
The Aussie at 16:37 you gotta feel for him
Hats off to the umpire. Truly
15:25 celebration
Bruh
That's the reason I love test match cricket... India vs England/Australia and Ashes always great to watch.
Who came here after ben stokes odi retirement??
"13:59 clear fixing that was not mistake ...these are players who play for country they are not that bad to miss that easiest run out and they don't do these silly mistakes every matches are fixed those who say all matches are not fixed are fools ..only those matches are not fixed in which line dosent come and don't ask what is line..
Above 90 percent matches are fixed"
Jack Leach was the real Hero tho. You cant score any runs if the guy at the other end cant stay there.  Plus Stokes ran Buttler out AGAIN
One minute silence for T20 supporters
14:34 WHAT A MOMENT
Best match in history of test cricket
One of the one best test match i ever  seen in my life ..what a matchhh
"Anddddddddddd:- The man of the match goes to """" Nathon Lyon and Tim Paine"""""
"Fortune favours the brave! Best cricketer of the world, Lord Ben Stokes. 🥰"
When team is in unbelievable pressure this man remember the Ben stokes performes i was literally hopeless when Ben stokes started hitting i was slowly seeing the light of hope when there was a chance for runout my heart just stopped that lyon was just sensational and unlucky but i danced for almost five minutes after England won the game what a match was this
Man of the match : Joel Wilson 😂
I came back to see this incredible innings of all time !🙌🏼
"Once upon a time,there was a Ben Stokes 🔥"
💞💞💞💞
He got lucky a few times but as the saying goes.. Luck favors the brave... This is one of the greatest single Games in the History..
Jimmybiscut
Test cricket is the only thing I watch so patiently!!
T20's can never generate this kind of excitement and games between good sides will take the excitement to the next level
Best example of commentators curse 😂
All thanks goes to umpire paul by British England.
Ben stokes ❤️🔥
andddd Test matches are boring 🙄
At the end umpire clearly didn’t give him out that’s was for sure out. I don’t know unpair didn’t give out lbw purposely or no
5⃣5⃣🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
"I have never seen like this match in past (test),latest match is ind vs aus pant innings never ever comi like that type of test match incredible innings
1.virat innings 149 ind vs aus

17:02 to 17:14 🤩🤩
Lots of drama in this match but how 🤔 to be a good batting Ben stokes
Match fixing🤣🤣 match
Why don’t they let the fans keep the balls they catch? Are they that hard up for money? 🏏
Poor captaincy and Lyon dropped the ashes

Stokes The Saviour of England
Its umpire who is the HERO. Blind c*nt cant give an out for a PLUMB
England fans are so crazy..
Exceptional
When stokes is chasing fortune falls down in his knees
"What about SL vs SA test match ""kusal perera""s inning?"
Whatever people might say.. Even this greatest match was the result of poor umpiring.. Australia won it but the stupid umpire had other plans.. when we have got such good technology available Whtever out or not out should be decided and overturned right away.. otherwise it dsnt make any sence
"3:53 -- What aa crowd.., Wow.."
Ben is done. Wow .
Be it cricket or football English crowd is just amazing
Man o man i got goosebumps. Heartstopping moments
One of the Greatest Innings in the Test Match Cricket.....🔥🏏 Ben stokes is Deserves the Day
17:05 that's a magic moment captured by camera 💥
Show me better test match than this. Watching in 2022
"Have a look at that the crowd noise, it looks like a football match"
Too many dropped catches
Stock you are the beauty 😍
Excellent betting binn stocks ❤❤💯

Most Epic innings ever!
"Hard work can change "" 1 wicket to win"" to ""1 run to win"""
father of all Test matches.... GREAT TEST
BEN STOKES 😎 SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR ENGLAND 🔥🏏
This match is comparable to Edgbaston 2005.
Leach played very well........😀😂😂
"Real The God Of Cricket
Ben Stokes World 🌎
Best All-rounder
One Man Army👌👍🤞💥🔥"
"on the paper england won this match

Everything is here 17:10 joy sadness celebration in one frame
I love Ben Stokes
Luck matters
That shout by everyone at the stadium near 15:23 ! (Watch it from 15:20 rather exactly at that time!) That is more than enough to show my emotion here!
Sometime Test Cricket Also Need T20 Format👍
One of the stylish all rounder in the world after Kalis 🔥
This match will be remembered for ever
Imagine being the guy against Josh Hazlewood
Jack leach scored the Greatest single of all time and Ben Stokes chipped in with 135*.
Watching post Bazball vs india at edgebaston
Ben strokes is real G. O. A. T
Most interesting day of test match cricket
One of the best innings..one for the Ages.. Seeing this after India Lost at Edgabston and thought why India didn't bowl like aussies outside off stump to bairstow and others.
Semma  match
If u work hard god make luck always be with u
Best chase
I'm Indian but I say that England test fanbase is just unbelievable.
The best ashes test ever
"This has to be the most entertaining game of cricket and the best individual innings in test cricket from Ben Stokes, what a player he is, deserved to be the captain of England 🙌👑"
Love Mark Nicholas Commentary
Watching Again And Again Everyday🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Lol kids say england cheated to win, what clowns 🤡"
Hard work + luck
What a player
17:06 literal goosebumps!!
Even crowed clapping for 1 run of innings think how important test for them
Ben stoke ❤️
Excellent innings
This man shows one man show against Australia
Lost review uselessly. Lost the match painfully.
6:55 what that man is doing behind😂😂
One of the best match
Australia lost this match due to tim paine's bad captaincy taking drs against leach if that drs would have been there then stokes would have out
I am leaving this comment here for future generations.
what a cricketer
"2 runs to win for England... 1 wicket to win for Australia... Umpire gives a wrong decision for lbw.. If it were India, we would hear about it for next 100 years 😂😂"
"TP saying “what’s that missing?” repeatedly to the ump is hilarious given his decision to review on Leach clearly pitching and impacting outside leg. As keeper, he’d have been moving down leg side to take the delivery…yet still reviewed. 
Was as good as throwing the towel in assuming that’d be the best opp to review and last chance to get a wicket. 

Set the tone for Lyon’s to fumble and others to drop."
Jack leach's contribution is equal to ben stokes
He didn't celebrate on 100 because he knew there's a lot more to do
This stoke's inning should be in cricket game 🔥😁😁
Cheeting for umpaire
This is the kind of match that you would show to your American friend who has not been into cricket before
This is unarguably the best Test Cricket Match of all Time.
Kusal perera's innings against s.a is better than this innings
Fun fact - 90 percent of commenters are indians
Beautiful camera work @17:00
I wish BoJo would watch this  and see just how  a leader does his job
"There is something about Headingley and there is no doubt that the passion of England fans is unrivalled anywhere. Being the home of football is the reason, particularly as Australia and the rest of the test playing nations have no meaningful history in that game. I have seen dismal England performances all around the country, yet any glint of hope is always met with fervent support and even heavy, shambolic defeats are met with a gallows humour and a loyalty to keep going to games - again, because of the loyalty honed from following your football team. 

I remember seeing grounds empty after a few hours in Australia when Cooky and Co put them to the sword. Melbourne and Sydney back in 2010/11 saw tens of thousands leaving the ground as soon as things didn't go their way, yet nine down at Headingley and all seemingly lost saw not one fan leaving their seat. Our support is unparalleled."
"It might have been the same results like Edgbaston 2005 if they didn't wasted their review.
mannn this is so much really. 
I love cricket so much."
this is one of the greatest test match ever.
"Tim paine, s wasted review really broke my ❤"
Test are the best
RIP for all those guys who thinks test matches are boring
I salute to ben stokes from deep of my heart even though I am from India
It's not fare stokes is lbw
Man of the Match umpire🤣
"This is not one of the greatest innings played. This is ""The Greatest Innings Played"""
No words for Ben stokes ...still fighting at the end.. One Man Army 🌟
Only one word for this extraordinary innings oh benstokes🤣🤣🤣
Has he Dropped the ashes
"AUSSIES WON THIS MATCH BY 1 RUN , BAD umpiring ...
In 14:56 STOKES is clearly OUT.."
This match went from an Australia win to a tie to an England win in 10 minutes. What a Test Match!
No Nathan Lyon was harmed in this match
Not a convincing WIN for England lucky win for England it was easy run out and easy LBW decision for umpire why umpire didn't give out can't understand
Ben stock is a real player of cricket ❤️👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Fixing all over this test. Last hour is hilarious🤣🤣🤣
This match appear to be fixed.
"Stokes is like Vincent Van Gogh...""I have to finish this painting"" ""I started it...I'm going to finish it"" Eating the paint and totally focussed on completion...""I will finish this!"""
Aaahw 13:55
"Test match cricket.....the best competitive game on the planet. One man versus 11...maybe 2 men versus 11. But one man can turn a game....a full on game of chess, aggression, tactics, bullying, bravado, skill....cricket is the best game!"
What an absolute time to be British
I like the crowd
"Mark My Word even in Year 2050
""One of the Greatest Test Ever😍"""
11:00 the headbow from Stokes at non striker end after Leach defends the ball successfully
Oh look an English crowd actually caring about a sport other than football
If you didn't add that lbw appeal against stokes when 2 runs needed for victory i would've enjoyed this highlights tape extremely well...
Thanks u cricket🙏🙏🙏
"Three years on and I still get emotional watching this, even knowing that the ashes were lost.  It was simply incredible.  Incredible."
Test cricket is love ♥️
''Ben stokes' Ben stokes ! in Virat's word😆
It was tim paines wasted review that costed them the ashes..
Crowd is getting mad when leach plays  dot ball 😂
Test is the best.
umpire always support own team.  if they can
The legend
I'm always amazed when you have a silly point or mid wicket..the fielder always shits himself when the ball is rattled towards him
Luck is always favor Ben Stokes....In Big match
best best best best best no words ❤🇵🇰
If only Australia had a review left
Stokes hitting Aussies all over the park. One of the best innings I've witnessed
"I pass Headingley quite a lot.  Just outside the ground is one of those electricity units that everyone decorates.  And on that unit, someone has painted it white and added Stokes score, and also Leach's score with a pair of spectacles next to it"
Ben stokes proved... His skills and work after 2016 unbelievable loss
"Our family was camping through France. We sat in a McDonald's glued to a little radio. When Stokes scored the winning runs we went as crazy as the crowd, running and jumping around the car park. The French customers looked concerned for our mental health. Even if I spoke good French I could never have explain to them the magnitude of what happened on that glorious day."
Such a beautiful day at a moment.🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
the greatest 1 not out of all time
One of the most dramatic cricket matches ever... ❤
Ben Stokes is the greatest cricketer of all time. No doubt about that👏👏👏👏
Its nice to come here time and time again to watch something that you cant even imagine
Watched live and every ball of last phase was awesome
They can play this at my funeral.
14:07 he almost had a heart attack there. The 4 players I admire the most from england are jos buttler johny bairstow ben stokes and jimmy anderson.
sixth wicket of England is not out
Here after Jonny Bairstow's majestic Centuries and Stokes heroics...
Anyone is watching this after trend bridge match vs newzealand. 2022
Jos buttler is out by nuttler😂
Who's here after the Eng vs NZ test?
"Stokes didn't celebrate on 50, 100 and series of heart breaks in Lyons over. Everything came out at end.... What a great innings from Stokes & Leach..."
"Australia full team = Ben stock
Result won the forever test match 💥"
these type of matches keep test cricket alive!!!❤❤
Too many errors by Australia
This is the best ever test match I have watched
hii
Historical Match ____hero stock 🔥🔥🔥
One man army : Ben Stokes!!!
simply one of the most exciting moments ive witnessed in sport and im not a particularly big fan of cricket either.
A remarkable test match remembered for many years....
Australia had their revenge last year for that🤣
"nothing, nothing in the world can match the feeling of being Ben stokes hitting that winning boundary and crowd erupting. this is purest high as a human being."
What a blunder nathon Lyon did😬🤣🤣
"All Australia needed in this match was ""Starc"""
17:00 the GREATEST capture of sporting theatre I have ever seen.
❣️
If Australia didn’t waste there review on something they knew wasn’t out we would have one what were they doing
ohhh My God What A match wow
Ben stokes is the hero of the land!
Always brings a tear to my eye 😅
I was getting goosebumps when he played winning shot..........................
commentators really did this performance justice
one of the greatest test matches
Who are the commentators - apart from Boycott?
Ben stokes was lbw out. but with the help of umpire England won the match. It's not England's victory. It's umpire's victory.
Anyone here in 2022 ❤
"Test cricket lads, test cricket"
Still this match hits different . One of best
One Of The Greatest Test Match I Have Ever Seen
if you see. Nathan Lyon was not collecting any throws properly
Test match is the real game ❤️
"This guy is worth the very penny you pay, England! Remarkably cool Ben Stokes!"
What a moment 17:08 💯💯
Sad to think they made a convicted gay bashing Kiwi their captain and changed the ECB rules to play a West Indian U/19 player to bowl for them. English. What lovely people. And lets not forget Ben Stokes making fun of mentally handicapped children. Nice.
16:59... That angle...❣️❣️❣️
only because of empire 🤮🤮
See them shaking hands...Thats sportsman ship...
Goosebumps guaranteed 💕
"It was actually Ben's day....
Wasting the previous review,
For which Aussies afterwards came to knew,
Few more dropped half chances catch,
Took Australia out of the match"
When god himself don't want you to win. Feeling bad for Australia.
"It is fun watching this innings even today.  
Winning pose OP. 👑"
This maybe an old topic now but was Buttler’s run out even a run out? Looks like empty hands took the bails off after ball missed stumps.
Tim Paine greets Stokes with a genuine smile and a handshake at the end.
Burn everything down to ashes
My life the best test match
Its a ritual to come here once in a while
This video has to be declared a time capsule... A heartbeat here is 18 mins on earth... ❤️❤️
"Ohh Ben stokes U beauty.
What a game,what a greatest game,in the world of 20-20.
Well done man u keeps the test matches alive."
Well australia definitely learned to not waste reviews from this series
This matches always gives me chills.watched it more then 10 times.
"urgh, Vaughan and then Mark ""the prattler"" Nicholas. Hello mute button"

Deadliest prime of stokes - 2019
"One of the match,I watched many more times all the time goosebumps 👏"
Very good innings
"DISCLAIMER :  NO  ""LEACH""  WAS HARMED IN THIS INNINGS 🤣🤣"
at 15:27 he did that celebration because back in 2016 t20 world cup final after England lost in last over in the stokes bowling Carlos brathwaite did that celebration so he did that now to tell everyone that he is in beast mode till now 2022 nz vs eng he is in that mode.
hi all I am from India btw I like Ben stokes all round performance
Leach Is My Hero❤️
"If I was an Australian, it would have taken me a month to recover from this."
63 times watched try to do 64 time
butler wasnt out the fielder dropped the ball and knocked the bails off
Stokes smach🔥🔥🔥
"its not a game, its a movie."

Amer dheka sera khela aeita
Stokes turned the game from AUS needs 1 wicket to win from ENG needs 1 run to win ❤️ his best innings according to me ❤️
This match is for those who thinks MS Dhoni is the greatest finisher of all time 🤣. Ben stokes is the best player I have ever seen . ICC world cup is also the example of his legacy
17:02 What a moment
The best test match innings I ever witnessed.
Bad Umpiring 🙁
Ben stokes is my rool model ❤️🎉
This still gives me goosebumps🥵
Best ever match of world cricket.. Strokes u beauty.. Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
"Surely so many mistakes lead to the English win but that damn man, Ben stokes, he never gave up even in the grimmest of situations when everyone was sure it's impossible to win"

In WC 2019 umpire help England to win the match and in this match also.

Ben stokes wish you all the best in your captaincy
ben stokes didn't only win.He won the hearts of all cricket fans
stokes really is a legend....
🐐 Stokes
Most underrated inning by leach 😂😂😂
Its once in a lifetime to see an innings like this on the biggest stages of cricket anywhere in the world. Ben Stokes did it twice in a year.
"Aussies could have won the game if tim paine didn’t have used the review on jack leach , that one was pretty useless everyone knew that wasnt out ."
"THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEN STOKES FOR THE GREAT ENTERTAINMENT AND GREAT CRICKET GREAT RUN CHASE.
I ENJOYED A LOT THIS TEST MATCH.
IT IS VERY HARD TO SCORE SO MANY RUNS.
AS LOSING WICKETS FROM OTHERSIDE.
286-9 TO 362-9 (10TH WICKET PARTNERSHIP 76 RUNS)
WE SHOULDN'T EVEN FORGET THE GREAT CONTRIBUTION OF JACK LEACH MEMORABLE EVARLASTING SINGLE.
THAT SINGLE IS EQUAL TO STOKES 135.
BECAUSE IF LEACH COULDN'T HAVE SURVIVED THEN STOKES WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN ENGLAND A GREAT VICTORY.
BEN STOKES 135(219)
NOT OUT
JACK LEACH 1(17)
NOT OUT
INCREDIBLE GAME OF CRICKET.
LOVE AND RESPECT FROM INDIA"
Ayooo... Lyon
There's nothing like Test cricket.

"17:08 one shot, so many emotions!"
Are you kidding me Joel Wilson 😂
"17:03 British cameraman recording most beautiful scenes of cricket history 

Indian cameraman : wanna jerk while seeing girls in stadium ?"
THE greatest 1* in Test match history. Ben Stokes was alright too ;-)
"New captain, let Joe Root make his runs and listen to this guy"
Stokes you beauty
One the best innings by an Englishmen. That Ben stokes guy was alright as well
By far the greatest test inning of all times. Had the privilege of watching it live and I still feel a lot of happiness watching it over and over again. Today agin watched it when saw the news of Great Ben Stokes becoming England Test Captain. Congratulations great man. England cricket has a great future ahead under the leadership of a man with steel nerves and temperament.
Outstanding inng
Greatest run chase in test💥     Benjamin Stokes💯🔥
Who's here after Ben Stokes has been announced as a new captain? He deserves it to be honest. What a amazing all-rounder he is.
5:36 is that runout ??? The ball was in not contact with lyon
Crowd is real heroes
What a beauty
Nice england win
All time best all-rounder in all formats
Ben stokes
17:03 One of greatest scene ever in Cricket History
Great innings by Stokes...  Fortune favors the brave...
Never heard the name of that referee after this match
"I could watch this innings every day, sheer brilliance mixed with a little luck."
Always good to comeback and watch this again(repeat)
"Great how the whole of the Aussie team and staff show Stokes that respect. The clapping, pats on the back and telling him it was the best ever inning that they've had the privilege to witness and that it was a great honour to be part of. Most of all though how they said how they'll be able to tell their kids and grandkids of the great Ben Stokes..Respect Aussie team and fans for being so humble. Well done in taking the series too."
What a great game to watch. What a treat.
Umpire 🙌🏼😂
He was out tho
It has been a ritual to come here and watch this innings every month
Best🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Never get tired of watching this...Test match at its very best🔥
Greatest match ever
I’ve watched this 20 times at least. And every time I expect Australia to win.
"Watched it love, I couldn't believe what I was witnessing 😳"
Umpire Wilson knew Stokes was plumbed out LBW but he didn't wanted to take away the glory from Stokes and denied the easiest LBW decision..
"Even , i was cheering for australia but in the last stokes stole my heart.❤"
Fav match of all time !❤
what a game from england
Just here for the Leach’s run of the decade
Cricket was great before covid nostalgia 2019😍😍😍😍 love it
Goosebumps 😍😍😍😍
quá xàm
2019 The year of BEN STOKES
"Having looked at the stokes LBW I still think it doesn't turn enough on first look which all the umpire gets, I understand why it was given as not out on the field"
test matches have come alive post-2016-17...they are far more entertaining than any T20 or WC matches (except final).
What an inning Ben strokes you will be remember for decades for such a great innings 👏👏

"This is one of those occasions where even in twenty years time, you'll remember where you were and what you were doing at the time. It was a stonking hot day; I took my wife and kids to the outdoor swimming pool in Hampton, West London. I was listening to the commentary on my phone in-between taking dips, enthralled by England's run chase but then the wickets started to go. Just after Archer went, we headed back to my mother in law's house where we were staying and fired up my laptop to put the TV coverage on, expecting to see the Aussies celebrating victory. She had the worst WiFi router ever invented, and so I had to sit on her stairs in the hallway to get a signal good enough to watch it. Despite constant nagging from the missus to do this, that and the other, I watched enthralled and in disbelief until the last run was scored. An incredible day."
"Just watched this again,  nearly cried"
This is a world class performance by Ben Stokes. Just incredible. Every cricket fan will love this innings of his.
That ball to the head unlocked hidden reflexes for stokes.
Even watching the highlights that Natan Lyon run out moment give me goosebumps
🏏🏏🏏
"Who’s the Aussie commentator?? I know the voice,please help😂"
"I think I'm watching this now for 5,6 times or more than that... ❤️ Ben from India 👍"
Goose bumps we definitely appreciate leach for standing 🔥🤯
Fabulous
Awesome 👍
Remember the day ❤️
i didnt see such an idot empire like him
"The first highlight of Stokes getting hit in the head. I did that without a helmet against a medium pacer. Top edge I smashed for teeth. I took the helmet off as it was hot and sweat, forming on my glasses, stupid !"
not playing starc in this match was the biggest mistake
ben 😍
🔥🔥
"This is the best match ever seen in cricket history ❤️
Love from India🇮🇳"
If you ever feel broken or sad remember what stokes did in the match
Ben stokes
"Great how the whole of the Aussie team and staff show Stokes that respect. The clapping, pats on the back and telling him it was the best ever inning that they've had the privilege to witness and that it was a great honour to be part of. Most of all they said how they'll be able to tell their kids and grandkids of the great Ben Stokes..Respect to the Aussie team and fans for being so humble. Well done in taking the series too."
The best test match I’ve ever seen
13:56 most rewatched play in history
Jack Leach the hero

Cricket is not a just game... It's emotion
"Australia just won the match, but just bcoz of the wrong decision of umpire, aus had to face defeat"
"It is one of the greatest bating in the Ashes Series I have ever seen. Ben Stokes will remain in the history of Cricket. Brave Ben, Classic Stokes, and the audience, the commentator ...every moment of this match was exciting, tremendous, and full of excitement till the last ball. And 1 run from Leach took him to history.  Cricket at its best."

This is what luck called
I can see abd at 1:05
"Who is tell bored test cricket
Its was the history"
Stokes is out umpire not given it wrong decision by umpire
Australia lost because of Tim Paine. The worst Australian captain ever.
"Good to see the Aussies diving and sprawling in the field, we don't see it often, and it's a testimony to how great Stokes was in this innings. Incredible performance. Jack Leach can keep a ball out too and Archers fast hands contributed crucial runs."
if the umpire gives the last wicket  call English could have lost by 1 run ........fortune helps the brave ......ben stokes was really an iron man wall
It was Ben stockes vs Australia
Ben stockes is d man

Australia missed a trick by not giving over to James Pattinson he got out broad  with a Yorker and he would have got out Leach in my opinion
Really the greatest of the greatest 1 run of cricket history by Jack leach .Agree- 👍
Love from india🇮🇳 ❤
ban stokes is great player

An innings for the ages- Michael Slater
"Incredible Player, True Fighter"
Cricket doesn't get better than this
"Here after Ashes 2021, England lost 4-0.. 😑😑"
Avenged them today Aus 4-0
"To be frank wtc had made an impact, these is the reason pitches being more friendly and result oriented and thus we see some great matches, including this stokes special, india breaching Gabba, Myers magic against Bangladesh, and Sydney miracle draw and many more 💗. Test has become too much fun and interesting and engaging 💗💗"
"That run out damn , otherwise Australia would have won the match by 1run .... 🙄"
"I heard a proverb “Luck favors the Brave”. Hence, its proved in this match."
Nice player
So glad i did not turn of the my streaming that day. Ben you beauty...

Feeling bad for aus...first Lyon's run out miss then umpires wrong decision

When Sri Lanka did ( Kusal Perera) it in South Africa know one knew it"

God was with Stokes
This is hardon material 😂 Its a great match up when england are on it.

Tim Paine did the same stupid mistake against India. Never trust Tim for reviews.
Ben Stokes....A real all-rounder.....
Who is he????
15:22 Most nostalgic part
Was jos Buttler out? I THINK Ball was not in Nathan Lyons hand
Was Butler really out?
Australia lost match for catch missing & easy run out missing.
"Heart in mouth moment 13:50...

Greatest 1 ever!!!"
He is going again! He is going again!.... what an incredible innings.... what an incredible commentary... the sweet sound of bat hitting the ball is the highlight  of the video 👌🏼
It can be named as the bravest innings ever
what a match😍😍😍😍🤯
Great player Ben. He didn't raised his bat after 50 and 100. What a great player...
This match is top 5 of last 20 years sure
Best match🏏

What the match?
Ben stroke u r beauty
Saw this live. It was really too much to handle.
Remarkable match
"Take a bow 💥
""BEN STOKES"""
Probably the best innings I have ever seen.And that includes Ian Botham 81
Australia robbed
today we hummer the day light out of England!
Jas a bad friggin day for the Aussies otherwise they had all...nice to see em get their redemption and retention of the ashes 2021
The umpire had won the match for England
Best test match ever🔥🔥
That's what 1 wrong review can do🤐🤐
Stokes owes the umpires a few beers
this each and every time shrinks my heart...it takes me to another world
this innings from stokes is the greatest one ever played.....this match is a lesson...its a message carrier...hats off
The greatest innings of all time .. the other one as close as this is Kapil dev 1983 vs Zimbabwe
Such great match ever
We never ever watch a test match in cricket..... ❤️
Wish a watch it live🥺
Pinnacle of test Cricket.
Incredible just Incredible
"jack leache's greatest ""1"" of all time!!"
Ben stokes the real hero
India
Love from inida
"Lyon's Run out miss
And Umpires Wrong Decision at the end.
Oh Luck🤭"
"Let’s be honest, that’s the worst lbw howler of allllll time the worst case of an umpire not having the balls to make a call ever. Stokes is a legend though"
Kusal perera is best
Amazing 😍
Ben stokes 💥💥🏏♥️
"Legendary  Ben strokes  , Respect + from Pakistan"
"17:05 Aussies falling England rising
Beautifully captured!!!"
"What an year for Ben stokes, outstanding performance in the world cup final and ashes."
Remember The name Ben Stokes Incredible !!

18 minit video every sec interesting . the name stokes
"Leading crickter of 2k19 and 2k20. Ben stokes 🔥 😍
What a match 🔥 👌👌🙌"
Who is here after England making their way to whitewash 🥺🤣🥺🤣🥺🤣
"Thata the reason we should not take 13:18 Desparate review system, effected  at 14:35 .. Need to be more matured and should take correct decision rather than desparately.
Lost moments : one at taking bad DRS and the other bluff moment was the run out."
"No celebration after hundred, because he knows the job is yet to be done...never give up ..game spirit..Ben Stokes wtta player..."
"There's an incredible Hulk, and there's Incredible :- Ben Stokes"
Jos buttler and ben stokes architech of england
Ben stokes is very nice player
The best i have ever seen 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Love from sri lanka 🇱🇰🇱🇰
Sir ben stokes is a great real cricketer
"Nathan Lyon could do it 
And it was pitching outside leg Australia should not have reviewed"
So no one is going to talk about those crucial knocks from Bairstow and Root.
England has a precious diamond 💎 named ben incredible stokes 👑
Ben Stokes is really a hero of england
Ben Stokes can the Next ABD
It was just pure class plus luck was on England's side
Superb after this ashes v can always watch this match one of the best match
An innings for the ages.....Ben Stokes ...you beauty
"That needless review against Jack leach costed them, when they needed review against Ben stokes they don't have"
"Well I am disappointed with strokes in this year of ashes, he faced better bowling than today's Aussies but not able to score"
Just a shame that there is not this passion from the England team now or Stokes
I’m an Aussie and it is hard to watch but it is test cricket at its finest.
🔥
"10:45 Is it T20 going on ?
Ben Stokes the legend😂"
England won that match bcz of the umpire!
The lbw decision near the end ruined the greatness of it. Nathan Astle double ton in a losing effort 2001/02 is a better innings.
not a big deal doing this at home 😌
Ops
14.57 aus have won the match true winners biased umpiring
It is Real test match
If that lbw given.. Then also a great thriller match would be... Imagine just one run victory in test... Wooooo
Omg😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Stokes is big match player
Start of the day 2 not out off 60+ balls. That period from stokes was just as important as the brilliance at the end and shows why a brilliant red ball innings like this will always be the ultimate
What a match 😍❤
Simply amazing match......such matches will keep the essence of importance to watch test match!!!
Thats what DRS is about he waste him without any reason it was clearly cleary not out but he review then when eng need 2 run that lbw of stoke is out but its not give out if aus didn't waste he will win by 1 but i am happy bcoz stoke inning is just awesome thats why iam happy😂😂
Tim Paine was probably one Australia's worst captain.
He was technically out lbw lucky Australia ran out of reviews
"There was only one man between Australia and Ashes....and it's *Ben Stokes*,.."
"This match teaches us - Don't waste your opportunities...or better to say "" reviews """
Who's here after Australia won The Ashes in 2021?
it was more difficult to score last 10 runs for england than 63 runs
but this match deserves to aussies
🔥🔥🔥🔥
සුපර්👍
Nice
❤️❤️❤️❤️
What an innings Ben stokes
i will never ever forget this match in my life time....
"Australia had 3 chances
It was England's day"
"If austrailia didnt use that review on jack leach lbw, They would have won by reviewing the next, still cant believe the umpire didnt call the one on ben stokes out, that was as plum as you can get. But Long Live Sir Ben Stokes!!!!"
Chester's and fucker English(England)all player's know in Australia 3-0
Match ta umpire er vule australia hereche
Joe Wilson is the villain for Australia.
I remember that match so well as a Aussie fan I wish we won but give Ben Stokes Credit he played one hell of a match.
This is one of the most intense and craziest matches I've ever seen!
Where are all football fans this is cricket💯🔥which has the ability to hold his fans for the last minute of day no 5 of the same boring match.
what is happening now???
♥️
Test matches are the best cricket matches. This is one of the greatest match 👏👏

17:08 nailed it 🔥 it's like stokes setting fire 🔥 & nice videography by camera man thank you for giving us that amazing look 👍
Amazing match ever 😍🏏

Best test match ever
Does anybody else return to watch this  once in a decade innings again and again...or is it just me
Anyone else here trying to forget the horrible performance in the 2021/22 ashes?
Best test match I have ever seen 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Clear winner is Australia... Stupid Umpiring
2k29 is the lucky year for England
Who is after aus retain the ashes at mcg😇
"Anyone after Australia 3-0 win in Ashes 2021
👇"
Banano songlap
"Unbelievable. As an Aussie I was spewing, as a lover of cricket, totally over the moon. What a finish. I was hoping for more of this kind of fighting spirit in the current Ashes series, but sadly not to be this time."
Buttler wasnt even out lion broke it with his hands
2019 was Stokes' year no doubt
It was showing under the Australia vs England Boxing Day test match. I clicked on it to refresh the memories of this spectacular innings…
I love test cricket
BEN STOKES 🔥🔥🔥😄😄
"2019 it seems Ben Stokes win match by himself, roll on 2021 December  in Australia ashes already lost by the third test in three days."
Love from India 🇮🇳
16:59 This is what cricket is all about..........
Brilliant STOKES
"This guy : Ben stock is not a normal person
Wc final 2019 final 
And this final day innings"
Australia messed this up in so many ways
honestly... it was just pure luck for Stokes.....he's an average player by far
RIP that review
Umpire made the most contribution
Leach be like sala muje 1 ball hi khelne deta h
From Indian .i think this is Baahubali 3 final war

"Ben stokes and Leach please played very well but after a few moments it felt as if the match was fixed = for example run out chance , umpire decision 🙏🙏"
One of the best match
super chase
"This is the beauty of test cricket, witnessed on of the greatest match in the history of
Cricket"
This match never before ever after
Ben Stokes
One this match and once pant’s gabba innings are dont forget any one
2021/22  ashesh England team totally west aisa lagra Namebia vs Australia khelraa😆😆😆😆😆😆
Here for the 9th time still getting goosebumps
"Love u Ben strokes
It would be u once more for the current AUSHES 2021, the same situation but no u."
"After watching today's Butler's hit wicket in Ashes, I feel sorry for his run out too....."
One of the classics for all the cricket lovers. Ben Stokes take a bow!!!
"Even God didn't want Australia to win that day. The missed run out of Leach, followed by LBW not being given out."
"That buttler run out , Lyon didn't even have the ball"
"Super marvellous innings by ""Ben Stroks"" ilove This match"
"We all are just appreciating  Stokes and Leach.
But at the pressure moment Lyon almost took the wicket of Stokes.
If Australia had that review it would have been the day for Australia"
If Australia had the review then it was Australia's day
Ben stokes is hero of the match but joe root and joe dently has also hit 50
"Eng won the match and the Umpire, Aus won the Ashes and the hearts."
Best match
15:24 just hear the roar of the crowd
Unbelievable match I see this match again and again. It's a type of motivation to never lose hope. Hats off!!🙏👍🏻
Lbw was not given by umpire so aus loss
Joel Wilson giving wrong decision and Lyon not  taking run-out opportunity and amazing batting by Stokes
Finest 💪🏼💯
Great day
Zero to hero..
16:59 🔥🔥🔥🔥
australia won it actually
"And history repeats itself today in Adelaide. 
Almost.
Not really."
"if only aussies didnt waste review for a sure outside leg delivery 
but well deserved stokes"
👍👍
That WI umpire helped them/Stoke to win this match same as that SL umpire did in WC final in 2019.
Joe Wilson made the bravest decision😇😇
What a knock unforgettable 😱
Clearcut fixing 😎😎
"Before this match it was Eaden Garden, Kolkata. But post this match its now HEADINGLY.... Thanks to Ben stokes.... For the best ever cricket test match in history"
Anyone after 2021 ashes😝

Heroic
Greatest run chase ever..
Next level umpire's played that day😂
"From my POV...Aus Win
Man of the Match :- Umpire 🙃"
Watching 18th time..
Nobody else in the history of cricket could've done it. You are special BEN STOKES ❤
Australia is real winner
Fixed match 👎👎👎
I've watched this so many times over the years and everytime I've struggle to understand why paine chose to take that Jack Leach review with 8 runs to go!! Even the bowlers were telling him not to.
"Lesson to be learnt : don't ever lose hope

Aus : took that chance of review thinking they might not be able to defend the last runs..
Had the review not taken , Aus would hv won.. 
It was a thrilling match 🥳🥳"
Super Innings Ben Stokes ❤️❤️
Ben stokes...after this match im a big fan of ben stokes..u r the hero of this match bro..love u
This is the test match..i never forget this match...test lovers👍👍
Roar of the lion .....One of the greatest inning
stokesingly
Ben Stokes is greatest of all time. Acknowledge him. Oh Ben what had you done to this cricket match🤗😃
this is literally the best test match after the gabba one
That catch by Warner is simply superb 🙏
"Who realises that on 6:33 anyone said ""Pakad"""
LUCK B LIKE WELL I LOVE STOKES
"NATHON LYON B LIKE ,WELL I AM GOING TO B BEATEN TODAY."
"A victory like this only comes around once every decade, where the stars just align solely for you."
I've never seen such a Test match.🔥
"True,this was a great innigs by Ben stokes...but R.pant innings at Gabba will be the greatest...👍"
Fixed match
Incredible Stokes
amazing
I come back to this monthly to get nervy
"If anybody need some motivation. then u need to watch this incredible inning by Ben stoke what a beauty.
T20 final vs wi. He become a villain
And then this inning.
He prove that u can achieve anything in life just u need to believe in ur self 👍"
One of the greatest
"That desperate review of Tim Paine did for Australia,this is a difference b/w an ordinary captain nd a great captain..
I  m sure Dhoni would have never done this!!"
I must have seen this for thousands of times!! ❤️ Well played Ben 👌👌
This match is more than world cup
15:01 The greatest single of all time
They should make this in to a movie. The greatest 1!
The greatest test match I ever witnessed
13:21 best review ever
"Even though it was groundbreaking what Stokes was doing and it truly was something special, it was the circumstances that didn't allow me to cheer for him. Australia hadn't won an Ashes series in England since 2001 and I wanted to see us do it, we were so close and literally needed 1 more wicket.......But Stokes was the Villain. We still retained the Ashes which was still amazing, but not quite as good.

Looking back though it's awesome what he did, managing to drag England on his back to victory."
The Greatest innings in the history of test cricket..
God level miracle. Stokes bloods himself
Fact : Australia won the match by 1 runs last wicket : BenStokes b. N.Lyon
In real this is ban stokes day
Australia lost review against Jack Leach and also  match
Umpire was fixed lol 😂😂😂😂😂
I can't believe that is this test or not
Nathon lion was the?
Regret of not watching this match live . Stokes never looked uncomfortable even after getting hit on the helmet off Hazelwood early that day . Truly what this guy has achieved is not ordinary .
I don't care what one says but England won this match only on the mercy of the umpire. The last lbw call was clearly an out but I still don't know what came in the mind of the umpire.
Butler was cheated 😩
15:22
Coming from an Aussie.. this is beauty to behold
6:33 someone said pakad 😀
What a match
"Two things from this unbelievable match..
1- Never Give Up
2- It should be your day"
13:20 It was at this moment they didn't know they F'ed up 😂
This innings deserves 50+million views
poor umpiring and brilliant battting by stokes
"6:33 pakad? 😂😂Ashes me hindi..... ""illusion"""
Greatest of all time ❤️
Best innings of all time. Ben Stokes remember the name.....
🇮🇳🇮🇳I LOVE INDIAN CRICKET TEAM 🇮🇳🇮🇳
♥️♥️ i love indian cricket team 🥰🥰
Full fixing match yahi lagta hai
Because of Ben stokes & Rishabh pant Tim Paine lost his captaincy
"Poor Fielding
Poor Captancy"
Welcome! Welcome to the most nail biting day ever happened in test cricket 🔥🔥
18:37 best moment
God was 100% against Australia 😂
Bumrah vs stokes
Ben Stokes 😎
Incredible inning
"What a brilliant player he is , he never give up."
"Ashes day 4 2019
And
ICC cricket World Cup 2019 final
Never ever we can forget till END
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
England crowd for ashes always incredible 😲😲😲
As a cricket fan watching this 20th time but still get goosebumps every time I watch the last moments where run-out had been missed.
I am not sure how many times I watch this match...... Still feel the same what I watch the live match..... Cheers Ben......
14:35 😒out
This is unfair to lyon...because he got stokes on lbw..but stupid umpire damn everything...
"Don't do things in desperation, Paine taking that review is one of the example of it..."
"Lyon missing that run out was a lucky one for Stokes, but even luck favours the brave... Such a great innings."
"After living in the US for over 18 years and watching only American sports! As a kid from India, I watched, played and enjoyed cricket to its fullest but had given up on it due modernization of the sport and it losing its character! I can honestly say this match and this inning has brought me back to CRICKET! Absolutely amazing!!! That too in the ASHES!! Thank you for this share!!"
"That wasted review , that missed runout that wrong decision and one of the greatest inning...🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻"
I will never forget this game until my last breath
Spr
Warner caught all the catches like a super man in this match 🤣🤣
17:03 literally goosebumps
Very interesting to watch Australia is unlucky....
I think today aussie fans became english 😂😂
Thank you umpire lol 😂
Guess they can’t do the same down under haha
This will be a favourite for future cricket loving time travellers.
Outstanding job keep it up boss real kingsman in England team
This bloke is incredible
its a ritual to come here once in a while😍
"When life gives you failures ( T20 world cup 2016 ), Be like Ben stokes!!! What a player!! A real match winner ❤️"
14:00 cost australia the game 😥
Again Umpire Saved England!
Here again to relive this amazing moment...
Ben is a beast. Because of that match I watch test matches everyday
17:02
Ben stoked opp
Luck england  win match
12:53 the test match became t10 match XD
The gteatest 1 run of all time - jack leach :
"I don't see nathon Lyon had the balls in his hand when he took the bails off
Anyone feels the same?"
"these hairy-pairy shots wont work in australia due to bounce. you have to play proper cricketing shots. and you cant play them unless you have settled down. aussies bowl impeccable length with no free-bees: hazel,cummins,stark and lyon.
very seasoned attack. stokes has to work hard to contribute."
"Ben stokes will forever be a Hero
What a legend  !!!!!!!"
We need this Stokes back
England win for Umpire wrong cAlls
"No chance for out ( 13:20 ) But there was a  chance but they already wasted the review ( 14:30 ) 
RIP for Australia 💔🙏"
"13:20 This Decision makes England day Because in the next over it's out but There's no review left for Australia
What a match what a game what a player what a format 🔥"
"Well these are just worthless series,I am waiting for Mini Ashes FT.Pak VS Zimb"
"I bow to thee Ben! What a Hero you are?  Watching this video has always been the most inspiring thing of late to me. You showed everything is possible as long as there is hope, confidence, patience and aggression. You have achieved in a single innings what all the greats like Sachin, ponting, Lara, Richard couldn't do in a lifetime. This innings of yours and India's Gabba win has saved test cricket, atleast of now."
This is one of the most beautiful cricket videos for a cricket fan
moral dont waste your reviews
17:00
"Test is best, Ah what a batting by ben stokes✌️"
Best century of the century...special unique inspirational you beauty ben stokes😍😍😍
Stokes is a no 1 allronder in  the world
Love the way women commentators talk really deeply in a slightly shouty voice to try and sound like a man to prove they can do a men’s job. They end up sounding like a pubescent male teen who’s voice has just broken! 😅
"Strokes Wrote History 
In 2019 
And 2021"
Rumors says Rishab pant and Ben stokes still haunt Aussie 🤡
"Oooh,,,, what a match,,,, oh my God what a match... TEST cricket is miles ahead from T20.... Oh my lord.....wow,,, unbelievable"

An innings!Beyond words!!
"This is the most inspirational innings, Shows what truly test cricket is!"
Goosebumps overload🤩🤩🤩🤩 The most thrilling match ever 😍😍
"Either it was WC or Ashes, the luck was always with England.
The two australian players will always curse themselves for losing this match.
1) Paine for his desperate review
2) Lyon for missing Run out chance"
🐉 🐲  arrive
"This is the journey from ""need 1 wicket to win"" to ""need 1 run to win""."
Stocks Master piece

I'm Indian bt i watch this match More than 200 times..cz I love 💕 Ben.He's absolutely a GOAT
#13.21 this is poor review taken by tim paine..If he not take the review this review helped them win the Match because Lyon LBW to Stokes but umpire decision is not out..Then Tim paine took the review its genuine Out and Australia win the Ashes..
Can't forget this innings 💥😍❤️
"Only Ben Stoke can 
Impossible to Possible
Hats up cricketer..."
Warner 's catch anyone ?
"After yesterday's performance, I'm here for some solace."
That is unbelievable
This is spirit of cricket ..

Here after eng got all out for 147 in 2021
"Define your career in a nutshell
Jack Leach: 15:01"
14:56 Agar Australia ke pass review bacha hota to Australia Jeet jata
When was that fixed in the middle or before no I mean that England were no where in the game before that run chase and Lyon missed that run out chance well that smells fishy 🤔

Only NZ WTC win is more valuable than this
This match gonna  be alive forever 🏆🏆
Maybe the '19 WC final ain't the only critical match that umpires won for England 😂
What a unbelievable match ❤️ not only for England for all country ❤️
12:11and 14:00 turning point of the match!!!
Australia win by 1 runs..but umpires not giving LBW out ..unlucky australia
Ben Stokes ❤️
"I am sorry but T20 is much better as everyone becomes a millionaire, test match cricket is too romantic and requires promiscuity to survive. Long live IPL NOT.....only joking this footage is wonderful and every reason why the ICC needs a complete overhaul to get rid of T20 and the money addiction."
9:21 original innings start 🔥🔥
This innings to Stokes - zero to hero ❤️
Stokes is the junior ab . Anyone agrees👇
SOOPER WIN 4 ENGLAND 🇬🇧   ....WAOOOOOOO

Bairstrow innings was also portant
Once imran Khan said Never Give up... what a great match
"Another day, another day of Cricket winning. Test cricket at it's best ❤️❤️"
Credit also goes to Jack Leach.......he faced the dangerous Aussie bowling line up.....and didn't give his wicket down to them....being an 11 no. Batsman...its actually very hard to do...
"Stoke’s lbw , umpire was a 12 th player"
Ben stokes remember the name ❤️
17:08 That's Speechless
6:40  Pakad🤣🤣
"Kids like t20s

"0:05
Moments before disaster 🔥❤️"
England will the ashes in downunder in few weeks
joe root fav

Can we also appreciate leach for his efforts .....
Sir bengmen stokes ♥️♥️😍😍🙏
"When stokes on the field,  miracle says, I am coming."
Best match
Ben stokes innings  > any other great innings combined.
Ben stokes to AUS is like Martin Guptill to IND.
"Greatest Test Match I've ever seen after VVS Laxman 281 at Eden Gardens, Kolkata"
Live കാണാത്തത് നന്നായി കണ്ടിരുന്നെങ്കിൽ അറ്റാക്ക് വന്ന് ചത്തേനെ 🙏
"Leach was true to to his name. Well, not his name but he did stick there as a leech better than most leeches do i would imagine. Still can't believe Stokes was 61 when they were 9 down. I can frankly say it was the best Test Match i have ever seen. My best before this has been Ind vs Aus Kolkata '01. We were kicking ass and stopping streaks that match. As a better comeback I still haven't seen any better than that but that may just be the emotions attached with it. That's also fine by me😁"
Two most dramatic and most intense test match Gabba And Headingly and guess which country lost in both matches? Test cricket at it's best
Incredible.
Australia ki maa ki choot!
Aus🤩
Seen 5 th time
"Australia gave so much lives to Ben stokes for 10th wickets. And at the end, England won the match"
ben stokes and jos buttler are so crucial for englan especially ben stoke
"Aus ko jeetna chaiye tha, ben stokes out tha eak review nahi bacha bus"
THE BEST INNINGS EVER😭👏🔥
"I think this is the greatest test match in cricket history,salute stokes boss🥰🥰"
14.28 14.29😂😂😂😛😮😮😮
What a Match
This never get old 😎
"One of the greatest inning ever, every batsman waits for this , his entire career and only 0.1% achieve it."
This was best innings anyone can dream to play. Even some one making a moview won't write a script like this. Unbelivable  drama!
Honestly this is the best chasing I ever seen...
Watch more than 50 times but still love the match
Nobody is talking about how important is Mark Nicholas commentary especially at Ashes. Ashes 2005 and this one. He nailed each time
"This wasn't a match, this was a ""once in a lifetime oppurtunity"" to watch for all cricket fans.

All hail God BenStokes."
14:02 all plays on their knees but captain Paine turns around and gets on with it. Respect.
One of the greatest match ever in test 💪
"11:22 ""An innings for the ages, an innings that keeps the ashes alive...!"""
17:04 moment hai bhai moment hai
I seen this match so many times
Miss you Ben stocks In T-20 CWC -21
This is the first in England a cricket stadium sounded like a premier league football stadium!!!! 💯
16:55
Best teams💛💙
8:13 this scene🔥🔥
This is insane test match i have ever seen in my life and BEN STOCKS is hero for england in world cup and ashes also BEN STOCKS rocks🔥
The morning session is often overlooked but that gave the platform for the afternoon heroics.  Runs were piled on for the loss of just one wicket.
17:09 goosebumps 🔥
On that day Ben performed great but England were so luky because Australia mades many mistakes they droped many catches and lyon made a great mistake about the run out.
I watched this inning many many times 😍 respect from pakistan
"Unforgettable, take bow Ben Stokes, you have given us the innings of a lifetime!"
15:12 the greatest 1 of all time😅
"Phenomenal cricket innings you get to see in any format 🔥
Ben stokes is a player of lifetime !!
Don't think we will see a better innings than this one in the next 20 years atleast"
The Hercules performance 👏
Supper Bean Stocks
Who are all got this reaction😲hit like
This is cheating
Best Test Match In The History Of Cricket 🏏 🔥🔥🔥👍
"This is the different between our fuckning kohli,rohit ,alu alu rahul like players and player like ben stoaks.ben rocks in knock out matchs and indians opener got fucked against newzealand"
"Belive me He can't plays classy shot like rohit, virat,root, smith but the best things about ben is he always counters attack bowler (with match sitution)with fully confident. The man with zero nervousness."
Cricket and is 3 with us for the spellings next weekend week for and Write Cover letter and Write Cover
Once a legend said: one bad descision could ruin ur life
jack leach obe.
best innings of all time with ease.
Total fix
14:52   he is OUT!!!😨😨
What a match?
"The boldest batting performance in history, I remember watching live and I'm still in awe, one for the ages"
"Australia didn't lose to England,they lost to one man called Ben Stokes. This guy is unreal."
I watch this highlights and realise how much I love this game! ❤️
"It wasn't just England who won that day,the winner was cricket."
never forget this match
17:12 what a work by camera men
Wow. As an Australian I was cheering for Stokes last few minutes. Well done mate.
Stoksy!! 🐐🔥
INCREDIBLE BEN STOKES MY FAVOURITE PLAYER OF INTERNATIONAL CRICKET LOVE FROM INDIA
"When I getting sad and frustration, I see this match..and get motivated... Focus on our goal... What a player , one in a generation❤❤❤❤"
The luck of england team
England won 🥰
Lol 😂 leach run felt like he scored a century
If you watch that Stokes lbw shout in slow mo it hits the front pad first causing it to straighten - fooling ball tracking. Probably umpires call actually. Justice was done.  Insane review against Leach though!
Love from India
Ben stokes beast mode
Australians to lion : Tu jaa re 🤣🤣🤣
Ben stokes😎
Look at the crowd in a test match
Ben....💗💗
Greatest ever moment in sport for me.
Worst decision from the umpire!
"Always remember, Never take unnecessary review...."
The ashes 🏏
"1) Nathan Lyon had that perfect chance to run out.
2) Ben Stokes was dropped once but that was a tough chance.
3) It was an LBW off Nathan's ball. But Paine had wasted the review earlier.


But that's how history is. No victory is easy. Every victory to be called a victory is a hard fought battle with some error of judgements insignificant over time."
Super Jack!!!
Nathan lyon dropped the Ashes
The greatest test match in the history of cricket.
What a thriller match
Why is there so many Indians in the comment section. LOL 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Paine will remember that pain forever
"@15:29, the amazing commentary made this moment even more iconic 🤩🤩🤩. What a match and what an innings from Ben Stokes."
"@11:30, pure facts from Michael Vaughan 👏👏. Geoffrey Boycott rarely praises players so you know someone has played well when he does."
"After msd i love only stokes...
He has such ability to finish"
17:03 slow mo shot. Goose bump inducing. Special test special players special moment.
Great ben..
7:13 my cover pic
"When you feel low watch this video you got confidence and inspired .

"13:03

Zero to Hero Ben Stokes 💪
Stokes awesome batting 😍😍😍😍
Stokes played as it was a T20 match ..u gotta admit that 😂
9 sixes were hit this test innings and in some t20 matches no sixes are even hit!
I come here every few weeks to listen to the english crowd
Iam a indian but I love England
"English umpire cheated and gave not out , everyone can see that was out clearly 200 %"
I think buttler is not out how they given out?
This tella us that if u capable then no one can beat u
Ben saying their oppnents that ye tho apna roz ka hii
That one was special. What an innings from Ben Stokes.
Ben Stokes is the hero of the century!
I only watch this highlight because of Stokes and crowd
Tim lost this match.. what uselss desperate review? they would have won with review
"Everytime I see this I get goosebumps
Fantastic cricket play by both teams ."
But I thing Buttler was not out
Credit to stokes but Australian lost that game for themselves
Real adventurous match starts at 9:18
England dint win this... This was a .match handed to them by that bastard Joel Wilson
Man of the series should have been given to the pathetic umpire Joel fuckin Wilson
Very very Miss U BEN STOKES Please comeback in CRICKET.......
I treasure my ticket. My cricketing son had an existential crisis after this day. “Life has nothing more to offer.” was his summary as we were making our way home. All Ashes games should be played at Headingley when I’m there. Won all of them
That's called ashes. 😘eng
"The crowd made this match 100 times better 
what a crowd
what a drama this match was"
Nathan Lyon is a joke.
Legend stokes ❤️
There is somthing with Ausies and 359.
The moment from 16:59 was so Fascinating I got Goosebumps 🎉🎉🎉
No doubt Ben played tremendously well but still tho that LBW must have been given out when Nathan was bowling!
17:06 that celebration though 🥶
One of the best test matches in history of cricket 🏏
"No fair, real match winner is Australia lost the game bcz of empire."
The best test match of all times.
"a picture that tells many stories ben stokes relief, crowd standing up in celebration and nathan lyon falling in despair, what a match 17:00"

Wow ❤️❤️
That precious  one run   by leach
Who watch this match more than 100 times 😂🙋
Unforgettable
100 is Nothing For Stokes 11:13
The atmosohere is amazing
"Fact is match between England vs Australia 
And viewers is Indian"
"Love how Australia really should have won about 5 years times 
What are the odds of them throwing away so many of those chances"
Lyon's hundred in bowling was incredible 🤣
Best and entertaining Test match ever played in the history of cricket .
Wow what a day for test match history...
16:59 🔥
"I like this but the best was "" can't wait to get to the GABBA Ash ""😅"
"Ben Stokes, Mo Farah, Raheem Sterling etc  now a Canadian tennis player. . England's best"
One man army
Fixed!!!
still gives me goosebumps!!
Test at it's best. Well done Ben Stokes..
Technically Australian had won it....cuz of wrong umpiring error in Lyon's last over
For the first time I was overjoyed when another team without India won♥️💯
Amazing ❤️ ever
I love this
👏
Incredible Mach sir Ben stock
I really appreciat his confidence ..your best  all time
Every time England win involve a luck 😂
One man show by stockes
My parents and I were supposed to watch a movie that day. Somehow I decided to convince dad to watch this with me instead. My dad and I support England in the Ashes. Will always remember this moment.
"Fight of a lone wolf, the last stand of ages, game of nerves, the probability chooses the hero, its not an aussie -day -----  its a day for the cricket fans... long live Test cricket."
WHAT A TEST MATCH 👑👑
Its umpire who won match for England and not stokes
well played umpire at last 🤣
take review when it needed if you have oppertunity do not waste it
"From 67 to chasing down the recording target.  Fight, you can fight!!!!"
Great Match wow
One of the best test match of all time.... Respect from india
"An LBW given not out. Ashes.

A bat that strikes the ball while running, and the ball travels all the way to 4. World Cup.

Stokes is too lucky for England."
Incredible match in test cricket ever 💯
Stokes luck in critical condition x100 😂
Whenever i want Goosebumps i come here
Again same thing ill comment that its 5star innings played by stokes
Ben stokes dangerous batsman in this world............
This match had proved that anything can happen in cricket
For me its Australias game the two things that they have done wrong is that taken a bad review and that ball that lyon bowled to ben stokes was out and that run oit of leach.. but ben was aweasome but u think they get some luck in their favour also... but what happen was england win..
"Paine use review when 8 run left
And it's absolutely showing that he wasted review...
When 2 run left he had to chance to use review....
And get win the test match it's means
Life gives you a chance. Until u have to wait...."
6:32 did someone shout 'pakad' which is catch in hindi
Superman Stokes Saves Ashes
I am here for the 100th time 😂😂😂
dont lose your review until last ball lesoon
This video lives rent free in my head
"The culprits are Tim paine for using last review for outside leg
Nathan Lyon for missing runout
Joe Wilson for worst umpiring in the end"
"Comments section is filled with many Indian Fans shows their love towards TEST CRICKET 💖
Well Played Stokesy..💥
Hard Luck Australia
David Warner Fielding is amazing 😍
What a Game of Test Cricket it is..👏"

"Leech is a very good bowler , not sure why he is not getting selected"
This somehow seems more spectacular on every showing... what a performance you beauty
Looks like God wanted strokes to win this match
If its indian match it would have crossed 1B yt biews
Overlaid with Great commentary and the crowd were amazing
England  win this match and world Cup by cheating
umpire frod stoke is always grate player but umpire decession is wrong last movement
What if Paine Didn't take DRS in Frustration against Leach.
Everyone forgot who the real Finisher is. Lol Msd is best 😏
Very few dominators in cricket history like Mr Stokes and Lance Klusner who turned the games upside down
One of the finest matches ♥️
F.....the adds 🗡️
"12.13Drop the catch ❎ 
Drop the match ✔"
Rip for those guys who think test matches are boring
Wenderfull match
Nice 👍

"Tim Paine is the dumbest captain ever, How useful the review if it was taken at the right time."
5.27 was that out
Test cricket at its best! You beauty Ben Stokes🔥  I can watch this match 1000 times.
Umpire take the huge mistake by not giving lbw to the bem stokes at last minute because he was totally out
"Best all rounders of all time
Yuvaraj singh & ben stokes ❤️❤️"
Hats off to Ben stokes
if Australia have review they had won the match
This inns is very famous but no one talks about kusal perera's 153 against SA that was also top class
My all time favorite test match...
In my opinion 15:02 single is One of the best single ever in cricket history
"After that 9th wicket everything is Ben""strokes"""
TIT FOR TAT
Best match in 144 years of cricket history🔥🔥

17:08 the cameraman deserves an Oscar
"Both time Eng won just by luck (umpire's wrong decision) 😀😀

This knock from Stokes is ageless... I was lucky to watch this innings live on TV... I never get bored from watching this
"9:23

Australia deserves the win
He defines the TEST cricket
The first ball started with stokes pain ended with Australia pain
Tim paine one of the worst captain australia ever had...... when the bowler himself is saying that it will miss the stumps great tim paine took and wasted the review
"Australia did two big mistakes at end , wasting review and leaving a runout chance , Poor Ausis..."
I am From 🇧🇩.i will miss you ben stock in upcoming t20 world cup 2021.
"This got only 10 million Views and it's 1 year or more old , However India Victory over you cross 10.9 Million In just Few Days 🤣🤣🤣
Power of Indian Youtubes views"
One of the class test match ever
Surprising thing is that English players didn't run after win
"Worst decision by the Umpire at the end....

"Best innings in the history of cricket, once in a lifetime moment"

Ben stokes got too many lifes. Very lucky England. Unlucky Australia. Anyway Ben stokes fought very hard. Great effort

Home track bully. Can he ever play this kind of innings in Asia? 🤣🤣😂😂........
Australia was unlucky
I'm from india and he is my lovest player on the EARTH
"This match tell to everyone reviews importance
Australia taking unnecessary review in Cummins over"
BEST TEST CRICKET INNING I'VE EVER WATCHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14:24 where Aussie lost the control on the match
Umpires are supporting England and done cheating with Australia
One of the best Matches
This Is an example When you try to help yourself then Allah will help you.
"Oh man , two dropped catches , one missed run out , one lbw . All things in favour of england 🙂🙂"
"One of the best highlights package ever! Not even a single important moment missed. Not the current mediocrity that ECB delivers now - posting batsmen taking singles, multiple angles of a batsman flicking a boundary, showing players take the review but not the review itself. Hope the old ECB highlights video editor will be back."
Buttler run out was worth..stokes proved it
I am lit supporting both team if stokes catch is drop i just feel oh nice and when sometimes run out or obw is safe i feel oh shet aus is in hurry
Ben Stokes you beauty..... 😎
Kya bc kya khela hai I want to change the drs system
You just can't get tired of watching this wonderful innings
Crowd❤️✅✅
Bairstow the unsung hero✅
This is more entertaining than a movie script. Even it won't be scripted ❤

Such a great test match it was❤️
"I saw the final 4 runs more than 1000 times....
Woow BEN STOKES...."
"Sorry Australia 🇦🇺 
When u take unnecessary review 
U will get unnecessary reward 🤪"
Well because of an umpire Aus lost a mtch and World Test Championship final ticket also. It sounds funny but it's serious. Icc u should do something. Umpire decision costed aus final
Nathon Lyon match ki watt laga dii 🤣🤣🤣
stokes 50 run = leach 1 dot
One of the best test innings ever in the test history which stands in top 10
Thanks to empire joe wilson 😂
All thanks to Joe Wilson
Super stock to buy
You know why Aussies lost? Because they had not patience just like India does.
Hardwork+ Luck
Haha aussies missed two golden chances paid for them.
Waste a review when pitching outside of cost australia....they can use the review against ben stokes

"They say India's win at Gabba is the greatest.

Where the single from Jack Leach is still better than the whole Gabba fort conquer."
"Feeling bad for Nathan Lyon,how more unlucky could a player be? I think Stoke's heroics completely shattered his resolution that day."
BC Akshay Kumar ka ad skip bhi ni Kar sakte 😠😠😠😠😠
england beeen verververy much lucky
"Hmmm, England wins always like this only (WC and this match - Both stokes hero). Though stokes heroic innings, Plumb LBW denied by the umpire  shows that Australia actually won the match. But by record England almost same as world cup :)"
One of the greatest test match
Ben stokes thought this is t20 match 😂😂😂😂
What ever it may be bad luck aus no rev left
This innings shows how precious is STOKES
Just Goosebumps 🔥💯😘
Very good Benstokes Batting
"Oh its look like fixed match so easy chances even run out missing was so funny 
But great from stokes"
"Watch from 13:00 to 15:30, tim paine and Nathan Lyon atrocities....review and run out missed 😂😂 every one knows , leg stump missed but review taken at 13:00 and 13:57 , Lyon missed a  runout.. and 14:55, australia does not have review...... 😂"
Did you guys know that england won this test match with one wicket to go? Unbelievable!
That run out chance 🤦
Umpire ny cheating ki lbw out tha Australia win tha
I watched it live and that was the greatest thing when you have several heart attacks during hours 😝😝😝
This is an incredible chase...what a chase by Strokes..mindblowing
Leach did exactly what he was asked to.
One of the best
Oh my god Lyon what you have done 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Jack leach you are my herooo 😍😍😍
Best Test Match Ever
"0:08 Australia beat him

Man of the match  - Carlos Braithwaite
Ben Stokes was out LBW and the Umpire bottled it.
India australia pakistan england k darshak bahot savedan shil hote he
Bad umpiring.Ben stokes is lbw out when England needed 2 runs but umpire gave it not out.Australia is the real winner and they win by 1 run
The REDEMPTION 🏆
Match fixed
england wins because of umpair not stokes
Lucks favour the Brave
"They did knew that it was not out and they still took a review as only 10 runs were left (13:20)
They did knew that it was out and there were no reviews left (14:35)
This test match showcases that patience is the key and never lose hope till the last moment."
16.37 I think that guy lost huge money betting
ch this match 100 times Without getting boredch this match 100 times Without getting boredch this match 100 times Without getting bored
He kept it 55 Street.
This man is something else first in world cup Final and then aheshes omg
It was just like worldcup final
Why didn't I watch it that time
"This shows grit, determination by stokes is remarkable. Evergreen video. even after 100 years, this will be a legendary innings"
LAST IBW? 🤫
"Everyone is praising Stokes for England's win
But No one is praising Lyon for Missing that Run out..."
It is a fixed match
"I can't watch this without getting emotional! Watching the Australian fielders scarper around trying to stop the boundaries is magical. 

We look forward to having you back Ben Stokes but look after yourself first."
"Everytime this highlight comes to my YT feed, I desperately watch this.... One of the best💯❤❤❤"
I am watching this in 2021 from pakistan but anyway ashes tied😒😒😒😒😩

"I can't count how many Australia let this match go off their hands.... But, you can't take anything away from Stokes 🔥🔥🔥"
tim paine wasted review

If Australia had a review they were winning the match
SIR BEN STOKES!!!!!! nuff said
"Headingley 2019: England from 67 All Out to 362/9
Gabba 2021: India from 36 All Out to 329/7
Really Amazing Scenes 
But the Kangaroos were defeated in each case."
17:08 cameraman deserves special award for capturing this moment🙏🏻❤
Ben stokes....just remember the name... ❤️
🔥
Plz skip Akshay kumar adds on youtube 🙏...He is real motivation not reel motivation...
When you compare the views of this with that of Lord's against India today...Lol 😂
Is anyone gonna address the foolish decision to take review on such obvious not out only to have no review left later on Lyon's LBW appeal. Never throw your opportunities. No matter how desperate. Lessons my friend lessons.
7th time I'm watching this.
England is lucky Australia have chance to win but luck give to England
"Not the hero they deserve but
the hero they need"
moral of the story...... bad review taken by aus ........ result is losing the game. ................... indication to VK
Australia have many many chance to win
So excited Match
One of the best innings in modern cricket history i have ever seen👏👏👏👏
It was my favorite mach every second.
This this the match that can cause anybody a heart attack anytime
"ICC rules cost the WC2019!!
Umpire's wrong decision cost this historic test match!
Unlucky Newzealand and Australia"
When  the  god  is with you
The greatest test match
I didn't saw this before but i know That ben stokes played good innings and england won ashes....But I don't know that The innings was so crucial and awesome....Ben Stokes is one of the best all-rounder....Love from 🇮🇳

I watch this match again and again
100 percent fix like ipl
Who's here after INDIA'S dramatic collapse on Leeds
Man of the match jack leech
Leach is also hero of this match
This match was fixed. Quiet a weirded to see how Aussies missed golden chances and wasted a review on pitching ball in leg side. And the umpires were biased too
My favourite  foreign player ban stocks 👍👍
England and ben stocks has taken a lot of advantage from rubbish type of umpiring and rules in international cricket
Goo d c r icket
🥴🙏
wow
Inning of life time 🙏
2 min silent for those people who haven't watch this live
Road of villain to hero ft. Ben Stokes 😰😰
Eng need 2 run when stokes is out but umpire desigon not out when aus near review aus win match but luck always time matter luck is big game of all game 😀
And some people think test cricket is boring.
Even that last wasted review could changed the match result. If they have that one review left..stock would be out..but I prefer to see this result ❣️..stokes thoroughly deserves this win..what a knock✨.. one of the greatest test konck you would have ever seen✨
BENJAMIN ANDREW STOKES🔥🔥
He was out plumb…Australia should have won it by 1 run
bad luck for aus ben stokes was out
Review lost by Australia .....wrong time taken
"One of the best inning in test cricket. Ben Stokes is love. and Yorkshire's crowd, simply the best."
"best test cricket ever🥳🥳
who comes after 69 and 76🥴"
After the heartbreaking loss of 3rd test ind vs eng.......
The last crowd shout really uplifts my mood😍😍

"If Australia just let go of their love for Tim Paine, they may soar much higher"
Mai sochta huki hamare team ka match nhi tobhi sab indian comment kiye naki Australia aur England wale
Umpire decesion ruins the game australia would have won umpire favours england wheather its 2019 world cup or this
"-catches dropped
-run our missed
- lbw denied
- I am not satisfied to obey it as a greatest victory
-but I accept Ben stokes is a greatest player"
on the winning moment i had tears in my eyes...INCREDIBLE
"When you feel that you are going to fail in your life, just see this match...
BEN STOKES...just WOWWW....what a comeback he has made from ZERO to HERO..."
England missed headingley. What an atmosphere
Again umpire won it for England 😀
Match outcome decided by an umpiring decision
One man army Ben stokes
Best test match I ever seen
Umpire be like ye kya tha bc😂
Last decision lb  is shame full by umpire
Worlds best all-rounder
Indian Attendace here
Unbelievable achievement by Ben stokes
The best part is he didn't celebrate his century..... he looked for victory
They wasted the fckn review on a lbw appeal that anyone could tell was pitching leg side else they would've won the match
"if i was in ground watching live, i would have bite all my nails and fingers.."
This match heroes Jack leach
What a player Ben stoke
🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰
I love it 💗💗💗
"I love re-visiting this now and then as a reminder of what sport can be, I also  love reading the comments on videos like this from Indian cricket fans. So knowledgeable, so in love with the game. Fans of cricket first, their nation second. Hats off to you all."
England fans are just something else. Raw energy.
I give respect to Barstow hes the person who kind of kept the spirit England can win
Stokes played some incredible strokes wow
TITLE SHOULD BE TURNING TEST MATCH INTO T20
"I come here once a week.... One of the best pieces of cricket...... The commentary is also just 🔥
Mark Nicholas 🙌"
Ben stokes played really well but at the last time the umpire give wrong decision 😥 for lBW ..
Bcos of that unnecessary drs taken by Tim Paine nd Pat Cummins litteraly cost the game for Australia at the end...
"Situation like this , England will have always great luck and BenStokes 😀😅... Got 4-5 chances but Australia panicked and just lost DRS one over before and then rest is history 🍂☺️"
Best test match in Cricket history 🔥
England super team
"Leach also super controlled balls, stokes super batting"
2021-ind vs ENG see u soon..... Ind all out 78 maybe there's another....
Best test match of all time!

I had tears in my eyes when Stokes scored the winning runs
Fortune favors the brave🤩
13:56 - clearly this match was fixed
14:36 cheater of all time.
But this match already won by Australia lbw out is not given for stokes
"It's more thrilling than many thriller movies ! despite knowing the result , it still gives same amount of thrill ❣️"
On this day 🙌🏼 3 years
Ben the super man stokes... Only he can do this
And this was the day in 2019.

The whole match dedicated to ben strokes outstanding inning solo player
Test is best
What a match...one of the best test match I could never seen✌️💯
That umpiring error ruined this for me. Great innings by Stokes though.
The only thing that happened bad in this test is that It ended only on day 04.
"match eng vs aus

Stuart Broad be like- mere ko hi hamesha Yorker kyu 😂😂

England also won world cup because of some stupid decision in the end England nevr earned respect in world cup .
Bz of umpaire wrong this match won by England
Bro that's called fixing 😁
Aussies clearly win but umpire take a wrong decision
"Pure Luck for ben stokes this test match. So many drop catches, missed run out & lbw not out."
"We can beat England the 3rd test at Leeds If, the middle order batsman share a good partnership. We can win either ways at Leeds by 100 Plus runs or by 7 wickets.
Our bowlers can bundle up England soon and our middle order batsman MUST pump in runs. If our batting succeeds, we might win by an inning and runs for sure. Keep the momentum going and best of luck to our entire team."
Australia should have won.... Every cricketer with just a glance knows it's out.... Bloody umpiring
Ben Stokes remember the name 😈
14:00 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The umpire is the villain for Aussies.
Finest wine that all want an sip!!
"2016 VILLaiN
2019 HERO

Going into 2019, a year containing an Ashes series and a World Cup, he looked to be a player at the peak of his powers who had finally understood the level of sacrifice and discipline required to coax the best out of his undoubted talent."
👌👌👌👌👌👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Amezing player ❤️

"Importance review, aus waste that review lost their match"
Super
Where is starc
Zero to hero best example BENSTROKES🔥
His confident level was one different level
How's that ball straightening so much as per ball tracking? Looked going down leg in real time. Understand why the umpire thought it wasn't out.
Who is came here India vs England test match at Headingley
Incredible innings from Ben stokes
Leach once scored 92. is he newbie to bat ? Could anyone explain time line and about leach....
"@6:33 did he just say ""PAKAD"" (catch it in hindi) while the ball was in air 😂"
Why am I seeing only Indians commenting here?😂😂
If dis thing wud hav been done by sm indian player dn dis video wud hav sm 500M views....Take a bow Ben Stokes
Pain ko mila aur pain Mean while pant and Ben stokess 🤣🤣🤣
One bad review from Aussies
Ben the greatest monster😍❤
"It happens when you have tim paine as your captain, shittiest captain"
Remember the name BEN STOKES
16:37 should be a meme
"Oh aussies 
U missed so many chances
One catch
One run out and u waste that review🤣😆"
This match comes among top 5 best so far
Luck will support them who have done hardwork..  look at the Lion's run-out miss at the end.. I mean he dropped the ashes ...  Bow down for Strokes and Leech. ❣️
My best cricketer Benstock - virat kohli
"Kudos to the commentators, without the commentary the match wouldn't be so outstanding to watch !"
ENGLAND have A Really is a new incredible Ben Stokes  💪💪👏👏
Proud to a ben fan in india ❤️
poor captaincy and umpiring caused match to australia..
just too much too much pressure 🔥🔥💥👌 What a player ben stokes👌
"God decided this match for ""ENGLAND"""
I dare 80% of viewers have watched this video more than 1 time.
The greatest 1* of all time!
Not a fan of England cricket but man  what a test match.....Great Job
"Importance of Reviews. Tim paine didn't utilise those reviews and several dropped catches and more importantly Aussie Bowlers did not bowl wicket to wicket, they provide enough width and eventually they paid heavy price with their tactics. Take a Bow to Leech and Stokes."
JJJwwajjkWwwajjkwwajKwwajjWw
Test matches in england against England = love test matches
"Ben Stokes one of the greatest innings in his life. what a player,,,the best ever all rounder in history of cricket."
Yes it was perfect match
When you get many chances to survive 😁😆😆
Ben stocks donot have to prove why he is an absolute gem for world cricket 🏏🙌
I am always watch this when you tube recommend me
Greatest one (jack leach ) of all time
Australia left a catch 1 run out and lost due to this.🙏
Wow
At 6:34 I heard a word pakad that means catch it but then I remember I was watching the ashes🤔😂🤣
"This match gives us a great life lesson
""Fight till the last ball and don't give up easily""🔥💯"
"""One of the greatest"" test matches."
One man Army 💥🔥
"Worst captaincy by Paine

And also Stokes did very well"
"Previous highlights commentrater was Nusser Hossain..That was the best
But this commentrater is not good like Hossain"
One of the greatest test match last day
Australia's Bad luck 😁
My MOM is Joe Wilson who missed plumb LBW when 02 runs needed.....
"Grea""TEST"" win in history of test cricket"
umpires wrong decision
"Tim Paine , pain to Australia"
"Biggest mistake by Lyon and Tim paine lost crucial review on wrong time , Lyon under pressure lost the chance of run out 🙏"
"Why did he take the last review Tim paine, should have saved it for later"
Well stokes was plumb in front when 2 required...umpire didn't give out
Anyone in Aug 2021 ?
What a valiant innings by Stokes brilliant
this guy will  bring t20 worldcup to his country
"King Stokes ❣️
Love from Bangladesh"
"5TH ODI | West Indies Vs Pakistan Thrilling Match Full Highlights

@ The Best ODI Match Ever"
"First Stokes, Then Pant, Now Bangladesh.
Australia is becoming a Joke of Cricket."
"I was fortunate to follow the Ashes that year, there was no hope for 
England at 253/6, except if you believed that science-fiction could 
become reality. Was really in awe when I witnessed Ben Stokes transform 
into a superhuman being. Btw...the Buttler run-out...it actually looks a
 bit as if the bails had come off not by the ball that hit the stumps, 
but by Lyon's knee. I am putting it on slo-mo, rolling it back and forth
 like a 3rd Umpire would, cannot tell exactly. Has anybody observed 
this?"
Very Poor Captaincy By Pain..
Ben stokes great inning again.
This test tells every lesson for every captian
Everytime just .... Watching and feeling thrilled and goosebumps ✌️✌️✌️✌️💜
"Kids like T20 International... 
Men's like ODIs... 
Legend's likes Test Matches... ❤"
"Credit goes to umpire for last given not out, missed run out and dropped catches and last but not the least Ben Stokes the iron man."
And then stokes celebrates his century when he reached 135
"After the year 2019 ,Ben Stokes Deserved the BRITISH CROWN 😂"
My name is bond....... No name is Ben stokes 🙏
"Paine was feeling the real pain ,uff 🤫"
"They say luck favours the brave. This match is true evidence of that. A missed run out chance , a dropped catch and a clear lbw which was not given out. What a match !!"
Australians have played like chokers in the match at the same time stokes played an inning once in a while
Legendary persons are watching in 2021.🤣
Watching this several times 💪💪
Lyon ruined
When the history was created❤️
Everytime I watch I get chills...
Umpire played the final trick.. 😎
jack leach greatest 1 all time
England was lucky!!! 🙄🙄🙄
Leach
The luck was definitely England side so were the umpires.
Best test match ever.  💪🏻💪🏻
If the team has ben Stokes and MS Dhoni... Damn i will go to war also against aliens
"Seen indo×Pak test matches high voltage , seen wi× aus 1999 test series, according to me this was the best test match i have ever seen in my life."
Amazing inning
"Incredible inning by stoke.
But, Aus missed lot of chance, particularly, Nathan Lyan. Unacceptable miss by him
Although, All things is part of game."
Moral Of The Story : Use Your Reviews Properly 🙂
Now india defeated both lol 😂😂😂😂😂
Ghajab
🧐பா திக் திக்
Who is watching this month
It’s clear that Australia won the match. Bad umpiring on LBW.
"The Indian Lord's Triumph is more classic than this. 
These both teams is applauding Indians now & also scared too"
Lyon man of the match 😂😂😂
17:00 What a moment!! Pure gold.
"No word for this match, osm😊😊"
One word: Phenomenal.
This man (Ben Stokes) should play in next test matches with India which going on currently... He must join in 3rd test match with India...
Kismat se jeeti England worldcup bhi or ye vala match bhi
this match is a treat for al cricket lovers..
Why not india have this type of all rounder 😔
"Ise kahte h luck
Catch chhute, fir review glt liya Australia ne"
Iam big fan of Stokes from karantak
lucky
"Well, that wrong umpiring decision spoils it for me. Even though Ben played an incredible innings, AUS should have won!"
I was watching at 720p suddenly the quality dropped to 144p and u could not belive u saw hardik pandya in place of ben
Worst captain for ever he knows that drs is not out but take drs and loose the drs then loose the match
Help from Umpire :Joel wilson
Dessisson
But really win australian this match suppose ending umpire give correct discussion
"Australia would surely won the match and the ASHES if they won't drop the catch of Stokes. 

 🇦🇺 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿"
Was buttler Out their?
Very bad luck Australia
This innings will be remembered for ages.
Stokes is much better thn kohli root smith williamson babar azam bcz he win world cup single hand
Eng cheating
Ben stoke are superb player
"can surely say luck was showing back to Ausies✅
Last 2 runs were damn full of goosebumps 🤩
Great play by Ben 
Love from India"
Even stokes can't belive what happen at the end. What an innings you Ben
15:00 greatest single of all time
Pressure does it all...! That's what it did with the Australians🙂🙂
What a match ........... incredible
Importance of wasting a review by knowing it was pitching outside of leg.. If aus has a review left at stokes LBW they wins
Aus bhi jeet sakti thi par chatch run out sub chod diya
Who else are watching this match after heard about that 3rd test is in Leeds😜😜😜😜😜
What a great batting  by stokes
Waiting  this from king 👑 ind vs eng  3rd test leeds
"cant remember seeing such sunny weather, excellent batting conditions when India tours England!!"
i'm watching this video i think 100th time
Paine took review previous over when it clearly known as pitched leg in the next over stoles was plumbed in front -umpire thinks notout- Australia didn't had any review left... What a tragedy
Best match in cricket histroy ....ben stokes waaaa bhai ek number bolte
Its a dead plumb and Umpire seems to be siding with england. Second time Ben stokes win it for Eng courtesy Umpire😂
It's aus eithically
"And what about AMAZING LORDS - FINAL DAY 😂
( INDIA-ENG) - you guys ECB didn't gave so catchy heading & all  when lose against India.)😀"
Nathan Lyon 😂😁😀🤣😃😄😅
Hatsoff litch and ben🙏
England is nothing without Stokes + Luck.... Is there any Stokes heroics without Luck??
Ben storke 🔥is world no1 Allrounder
What a game 🎯
0:38
India coming 4 u soon 🔥
Love Test cricket
Outstanding performance stockes
MARK NICHOLAS COMMENTRY WE NEED THAT BADLY FOR INDIAN SERIES
Steven Smith should be new Aussie captain
Aussie captain crumbled under pressure
13:35 when everyone's heartbeat nearly stopped
It was Ben Stokes day
this is a proof that Cricket can be as Interesting or even more than football
Australia denied.Stokes was plumb out.
It's a Australia match not England....
Nathan Lyon and Tim pane were may be playing for England in coming time😂
"Without script, full drama...."
"Man of the match is Ben Stokes 
Man of the day is Jack Leach 
Masterpiece love from Srilanka 
Best match ever"
Worst keeping
Where was Starc in this match?
Criminal is umpire.
How can someone win in these situation. This is unbelievable.
Stokes the hero 😱😱😱😱
"with 9runs to win Aus wasted one important review when it was clear not out, then missed a easy stumping of Leach, then plumb LWB against Stokes not given which was solely fault of Aus for wasting the review earlier. All in all, Stokes played one hell of an innings while Aus just made harakiri in the end"
Truly the greatest ever ❤️
2019 THE BEST YEAR OF  THE CHAMP ALL ROUNDER THE BENJIMAN STOKE ❤️
Anyone after India's magnificent victory in Lord's test
My All time favorite inning ben stokes you beauty ❤️
Well done umpire
Best test inning I've seen😍
All luck gone for stokes side....
I get anxiety while watching this.
cannot write a script like this.
Greatest test match ever in history of cricket
It's is my request to Ben stokes 😭 please come in England squad please 🥺 . Joe root played very well and Jimmy Anderson also took wickets but England have required a allrounder which help in bad contition like 5 day of second test match . so please ben stokes come because sam currun didn't play very well in second test match. in both test match he only took 1 wickets
"Treat to watch everytime.
Heroics and thrill is immense here."
One of the greatest matches ...!
Cheater england
One of the best innings in chasing in under pressure
"Croud play role of 12th man, for home team"
10 million views and cmmnt 10k only 😭😭😭
Unlucky Aussie wasted review and run out and need not fear and open up field when 50+ runs required with1 wicket in hand.
Man only if luck has a name!!!!!!
Ampair is a nonsense
Credit goes to umpire 👍
Ben strokes Ben strokes ha
one of finest victory ever in history of test cricket
"I use this generally for motivation 😌
Am i alone??"
"Inning of Ben Stokes is simply awesome but It's not the win of England, it's a result of very poor umpiring. Yes, review wasn't left for AUS but it was clear out (Pitching inside, impact inline, no bat contact and middle stump hitting still umpire didn't convince at such a crucial moment). Why should team always depends on review, it's the umpire's job too to be accurate on the field. (Even if the decision was gone towards AUS favour then also ENG had their review to correct the same but not in case of AUS). So it was a very poor umpiring's result."
"This is the best ashes match  I have seen but it has only 9.3 million around views after a year and a video highlights of IND v ENG in 2021 2nd test day 5 has already 22 million views .
That's power of INDIAN cricket lover ❤️👍🏼"
Credit goes to umpire because of his wrong decesion it's clear cheating by umpire...anyone give it out...wrost umpire for any cricket lover....
Best test match ever👌❣️
I can't forget this match . Ben stokes🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😎
Who is waiting⏳ 3rd test between India And England at Leeds.
"Great match
Great innings"
16:39 Fckkkk
"England needs sheer luck to win big matches..
Without sheer luck England is nothing.."
This is the best test match that I had ever seen
"CWC WC final - umpire awards England the trophy , England gets saved by umpire Wilson in ashes .. gone are the days when they won because of KP cook n others"
🐣
This guy is close to Andrew Flintoff
What a greatest knock...what a player Ben stokes ❤️❤️❤️ absolutely masterclass genius
If cricket has a body then it's soul is crowd
Wow
Cut way cut way per four wanna innings  wanna player .... greatest player ❤️❤️❤️
Impossible
"Imagine watching this epic innings live!

Take a bow Ben 🙌"
"From getting thrashed(lost) by Braithwaite in a WC final to win a WC for Eng..what a story!
And this unfuckingbelievable test innings is just the cherry on the cake.

Legend!"
"Just when we thought the match is over .. Warner drops a catch and Lyon miss a run out.... absolutely bonkers

WHAT  A MATCH!"
Arguably the best test innings ever! Take a bow Ben.
Ben stokes is finishing power of england🔥🔥🔥
poor Umpair
Run out easy miss
"Paine is an idiot, but Australia still should have one. Terrible decision by the umpire on that last lbw chance…. Woeful, was absolutely plum"
"Not celebrated 50 and 100 but roars after winning, champions stuff"
"What makes me think is when England plays with other countries they play till the end trying their best but when it comes to India once their top order is toppled the score is stuck below 200 or 150.
Maybe indian pressure is too much."
Commentary here from Mark Nicolas is as legendary as the knock from ben❤️🔥
Good knock indeed
4 life
"Some bangladesh fans rate Shakib over Stokes , but truth is Shakib is no where close to stokes. Just 2 innings of Headingly and WC-19 final is enough to outweigh all the innings shakib played."
This match definitely fixing. At the last time Lyon miss run out but it was very easy to run out and umpire don't give LBW but in drs it shown wicket hitting
Massive luck for england team
"Paine will remember 2 names In his life
1.2019 (Ben stokes)
2. 2021 (Rishabh pant)"
"Run out and review wastage cost aus the match and the ashes. Though nothing taken away from Ben ""Superman"" Stokes."
I'm watching diz after India crashed eng in lord's
Real life hero
Headingley Eng vs Aus or Lord's Eng vs Ind ?
"Fortune favors the brave. Here it favored the bravest. What a game 👍. Will go down as one of the best test matches in history. 
Simply wow 👍😊"
16:59 it's just thrilling 🔥🔥🔥 what a scene
Oy Ben stokes 😂😂
England played well but Australia had two chances. One lost by Nathan Lyon and a poor umpiring decision
I stunted and can never forget that day what match was this
I saw this match
*_Overrated Kohli Can Never Play An Inning Like Ben Stokes In This Match._*
Umbire credit goes to England victory. All important match England victory's umbires and rain gifted.
A desperate review ruined the ashes
Legends are come After Lord of the Lords. India thriller win
Who's here after India's Lords victory🏆🎉
But they can't enjoy like our indians
One of the greatest match
I have never seen this crowd in any cricket match
"Though Aussies didn't had review left but ....What does The Umpire doing ...it was a Clean Out ....
Cleary Umpire supported Ben Stokes to win the match.. 😂😂"
Best Innings so far in history of Cricket. 🤩❤️❤️
Ben stock power
"In this ashes :- wrong umpiring.
In worldcup 2019:- Overthrow singal by hitting bat .

Ben carries good luck."
We are all waiting for season 2
India and Australia are my favourite teams but the way stokes played this match incredible!!!
One of the best match...but no better than ind vs eng 2nd testday 5..16th aug.....
Who is here after india lords test win
How dearly England us going to miss Sir Stokes in the next match against India 🥺🥺🤯
Huge crowd is amazing it is the spirit of test cricket in england
This Akshay Kumar add so irritating
"god forbibbed aus to loose.. dropped catch, wrong review, missed run out, lbw chance with no review left. just bad day. congratulations to ben stokes"
After watching world Cup 2019 and 13:55 And 14:40 I think Englandians are doing some 'totka' to win the match
Those who think test matches are boring get yourselves checked up. This is real cricket which we love
Bad captaincy by tim paine and well played ben stokes
What a fucking luck aus have!
"Amazing fact... this video 1 year ago only 92 lakhs views
And INDIA vs england lord's match 1 crore views in just  10 hours"
13:56 leach is sooooo much lucky!
"What a bad umpiring 🙄 seriously it was blunder otherwise Aussies should have won by 1 run, but this kind of win requires luck 🤔"
Best 🔥
What A Moment What Moment
Ben stokes is excellent but i think luck favours to brave...
Stokes bi like semi final tak jitnedunga but final me bazzi me hi jitunga
Austria feel full pressure in Last wicket because many drop caught and miss run out and DRS but it's pressure but what a brute hitting by Stoke now era test is Best because this kind of Batsman and captain mind set.This batting realize value of sehwag.
What a match
Greatest match ever... Great innings by Stokes...but it's an umpire match. .
Wow wonder here
"Remember the name ""Ben Stokes""😍🤜🤛"
Leach deserves the Man of the match trophy for that 1 run.
Most comments are from indian people that is how much we love cricket not just like u
I've come here after India's Lords Victory! Just because Test Cricket is love! 😊💕💕
Apni life me maine ajtak aisa match nahi dekha...
"Bad Luck for Australia 
1. No Reviews left
2. Missing easiest Runout"
I think iam watching 100th time this match 🔥
1²
Stokes-Leach added 76 runs in last wicket partnership🤝
Let us notice how the crowd was appreciateing batsmans. They were celebrating for only single run.🙌🙌🙌🙌
This match shows you don't need 11 batsman you need only 1 batsman and 10 good runner 😁👍
Who noticed 2:00
"I think match was fixed 
This not possible in test cricket"
Man Lyon's was unlucky on that day

AsLi khel to end me umpire ne kheLa 😂😂
Did anyone observe Stokes reaction to every ball leach faced?
Best test match I ever been Seen...Ben stokes 🔥🙏
This match and WCC final are the fix matches of all time
There are so many chances for aussie to  get that last wicket but one thing is with eng and that is we all know......
13:19 THE MOST REGRETFUL DECISION😂😂😂😂
Lots drama happen in this match.
"And this is why u should never burn your reviews 
Australia should have won by 1 run but Stokes n England deserved it more"
Ashes great match of history
Best test match ever
morale of the story dont take stupid reviews
Incredible ✌️✌️✌️
Its a t20 with white jersey
The time rise on ben stokes. After that who forget 19 world Cup final. That was best moment of english team
"U gotta feel for Aussies,missed an easy run out,poor umpiring, seemed like cricket wanted English to win"
13:36 the match moment😍😍
And the credit goes to UMPIRE .. 😎😎😎
"9 wickets down, 1 to go. Stokes turned on his T20 mode 👌👌👌 if you love test cricket, you will never ever get bored of this match."
That Jack leach's quick single and his innings in this test match is the greatest of all the innings he could ever play in his international batting career.
"Reminded me of Lara's 153 in 1999.. ended with a cover drive on both occasions.
Two of the best ever innings"
Is Ben better than my hero Beefy?
Umpire man of the match
Test cricket is the greatest game in the world..
That umpire's decision ruined the match.
Leach has played the toughest 17 deliveries of cricket history.......
Definition of one man show.......
What an incredible intelligent player......
This match was in aus or eng?
Tim Paine has jinxed  the aussies
Aussies wat have yull  done
Still the best innings I had ever seen
Drama from 13:54.....I feel sad for lyon
"aus will never forget
edgbaston 2005
headingly 2019
gabba 2020"
Match win by umpire by one run
i think the match was fixed. 1st : australian players dropping 2 important catches which they can easily tackle. 2nd : missing 2 runouts. umpire giving not out to ben stokes when we all can see it was clearly out.
"Everytime leach defended the ball
Crowds : Aheeeeeeeeeeeee"
"love the commentary more than action , what way he does , 
thank you so much😂"
Man of the match Umpire 👏👏
The umpire is blind btw
Benstok great best man
This is more entertaining than any Hollywood Blockbuster.
Salute to ben stokes 🤩🤩🤩amazing
"This revived my cricket hope. Love this match. This is not cricket, this is emotion , this is nerves, this is honor"
14:28 if this was the reaction of England team members then i Don't have any idea what was the reaction of Australia's team members.
13:05 what a stupid review from a captain who lead a team like Australia in ashes. This has to be the worst review taken in ashes history. And i can't believe he took that being a keeper. He knew it wasn't gonna hit the stump. Moreover it was outside leg. Even the impact wasn't in line.
"Is absolutely incredible, but I will always remember Broad's review. Madness 😂"
Where I can watch this full match?
To think I nearly  bought a ticket for that day but my boss wouldnt give me the day off
Absolutely brilliant innings. Ben Stokes knock weren’t bad either.
This is the best test match inning of all time and one of the best in all form of cricket and you can't change my mind.
Why does it look like it's super hot in England LMAO. 🤣🤣😅😅
Umpire should resign 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤯🤯
17:08
Next match revenge taken by smith 😎
Best of all time
ben stokes the super man
pura drama. hy phle. se fix tha ye
totly plan lgta hy yar
Best LAST DAY OF TEST match of all the time
God planed to win england . Lion easy missed;umpire wrong decision in last time
Ben stokes and jack leach your my hero

This video is for who say test cricket is boring
Best test match I have ever seen
Am I the one who is watching this in 2021
Ben Stokes is best ❤️🔥
"I have seen it live
But while watching highlights exitment is same"
The crowd makes it more beautiful!
Sometimes defending is the most difficult thing to do..
14:01 this chance 🔥❤
"I never seen such supporting crowd in test matches.
The crowd was awesome.
Hats off to the England supporters!"
"Here Aus won the match, cause the last one was clearly LBW.
Umpire was biased."
History mode for the eng 🥲🥺love from 🇮🇳
16:59 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Greatest one of all time
Commentators deserve Oscar
Best ever in my life
9:49 century for nathan lyon.....
"The Great Benjamin Stokes
KING👑"
Real hero
Great 👑
its clearly cheating stocks out and aus win the ashes
Thanks for tim paine and lyon😂
"I love the increasingly desperate yelps of ""CATCH!"" from the Kylies."
Greatest single 1 forever by leach
17:10 Cricketing image of the Decade
Ben Stokes the best cricket player on earth. He can do everything.
14:55 lucky af
Umpairing and Lyon with stokes win the match for England 👍
England crowd is awesome 🤟
Best test inning of the last decade
"Each time Paine hears the word Headingly and Gabba he'll remember only 2 names
Ben Stokes 
Rishab Pant"
Moment where Ashes dropped 13:54
15:29 mark Nicholls is d best alive commentator ❤️
Commentator : Jack Leach you're my hero 😂
Most foolish review of the century .
i always watch this when i feel sad..it instantly makes me happy :)
"Best credits of the match goes to
1)Tim paine for the review 😆
2)Nathan Lyon for the runout 😆
3)leach for surviving ❤️
4)and the rest a warrior 🔥🔥 in cricket u know"
What incridible knock Ben stokes my favourite all rounder all guys test match has bro but this guy played plenty of interest match remember the guys the thought entire life Ben stokes and Rishab pant this two guys are match winners remember the name all time
One man army
Test match of the century👍
"The best test match ever in the history of Cricket 
1 - England vs Australia Ashes ( this match ) 
2- Australia vs India 4th test match final ( toota hai Gabba ka ghamand )"
"Paine will remember always this two lefties 
Pant and Stokes"
My favourite part was when Nathan Lyon missed that easy run out. My 2nd favourite part was when Nathan Lyon had no reviews left when he had stokes trapped lbw .
stokes is now jumping on the mental health bandwagon. ie look at me
"Get well soon, Ben. We hope you'll get better and fit and ready for the World T20 and the next Ashes."
Cedit goes to pat for taking review on the leg side
Ind
What an effort by the second batsman
that one run( Leach) was the run of the century 🙌😁
"Whenever I need inspiration in life, I watch this match. Truly epic!"
I thought this match was of Cricket 19.
"From being hit for 4 consecutive sixes in a WC Final Over to playing a crucial role in winning world Cup and this, Ben Stokes has come a long way."
"Ben Stokes the greatest finisher of all time..

Pulled it through in both tests and odi.."
"For india rishab pant 
                                      Vs  Australia 
For england   stokes"
The unbeaten single form Leach probably the single of the decade or the century or the era....
Get well soon from depression
Australia should of easily won. Umpires bad decision cost the game
"2 Benjamins can't be compared to anyone. 
1. Benjamin stokes 
2. Abraham Benjamin De Villiers"
Who all are watching after ben stokes break in International
What a match😯😯.....I can't believe my own eyes..Love from Bangladesh. 🇧🇩
Really love the way English fans love test cricket.
"Very sad about such a terrible decision from umpire,it could have been all over for england if australia had a review left. Stokes would have been out."
"In world cup they win by umpire in heading they again win by umpire, not giving lbw"
The greatest test inning I have ever seen.
One of the best innings I have ever seen in test cricket ❤️🔥
"Everytime I watch this Match, I get Goosebumps!!!💯"
"Brain: it's 37th time you are watching this video in a month🤷‍♂️.
Me: shut up...let me watch again ❤"
God helps those who constantly do hard work..at last lbw call...god helped stokes for his lone fight and beautiful innings..well done stokes👍💯🙂
"All I want forever is these last day highlights ! It's fantastic ! What a test match ! Take a bow England, Stokes !"
Lyon the culprit 😂😂😂😂😂
"Even though I am an Indian but celebration of Ben stokes is best celebration for best performance of a best test,he roared like a lion.stokes❤️"
"17:05
Last moment gives me goosebumps ❤"
"bad umpiring, australia were robbed"
Happy to watch Australians crying for a single wicket there
"This is the greatest cricket match I ever seen  
Ben stokes literally lived every kid's dream moment. Single handedly hitting 50+ runs in  10th wicket partnership. Jeez ❤️"
Greatest highlights ever!
The nathon lyon delivery was clearly umpire's call. It would have hit leg stump slightly. Don't know how tf they showed it coming inside from that angle and where it pitched.
13:24 most stupid review in such a crunch situation.
The crowd makes the match 10x more entertaining and amazing.
1999 Lara. 2001 Dravid and Laxman. 2005 Flintoff. 2019 Ben Stokes. 2021 Gill &Pant. 5 greatest Test matches of all time and all of those were against Australia.
"Tim Paine would be like ""I will not forget two things in my life they are
Risabh Pant and Ben Stokes 😂👍🏻"
Both Are hero Leach and Stokes 🥰
i think gaand faad di bane dne
LEACH'S LBW WAS OUT. BUT UMPIRING WAS PURELY BAD
And some people compare Hardik pandya with stokes...
"Still get goosebumps watching this till this day...
Best Test innings in history, end of!"
This is Lion approach
Simply the best ..........
"One man army Ben stokey💯👌
Outstanding 👏👏"
"From 2016 Villain to 2019 Hero,Ben stokes showed that failure is the first step to success! 💪🔥"
"Australia never forget two person

Ben stock
Rishabh pant"
Are yaar stokes luck tha
16:37 felt sad for this dude
Only culprit pet cummins taken review
I will show this to my children.
Player of the match Stokes but Australia should have won it. Really poor umpiring and a few little mistakes by fielders cost them the game :(
The costliest review ever !
"Best test match I have ever seen in my life.
Best example for those who say that test cricket is boring."
Goosebumps ......that's why I love test cricket
Credit gose to umpire also😀
Poor bowling by Australia
Too dramatic 😍🔥
Corona be like .. that is a whole lot of buisness
Ben stokes is just incredible
One of the greatest match for all time
"I was looking at the scorecard for this match. In all the 4 innings, 8 sixes were hit in total. They were ALL hit by Stokes in the 4th innings.

I'll never understand what Tim Paine was doing just letting Stokes take single after single towards the end of every over."
"Australia got 3,4 chances but couldn't make it ben stokes played really well but that was england day mannn"
The best test match of all time
They couldn't get leach out
Really a great play by englishmen
Umpire is winning
My fav test match
Eng team valueble player ben
"I cannot remember this Ben Stokes batting
It's my favorite inning 
I see this 50 time's MATCH but I can't borring
Ben Stokes and jack Leach is Hero
Well played Ben Stokes"
This is trimendus man
God gave england 3 chances
Goosebumps 17.08
"11:37
9:49 .



















."
"17:06 GREAT SCENARIO TO WATCH .



















."
I got Goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥
Paine will
Empire bad diceion lbw out
All time favorite 🙂
"What was match ,..I can't believe it.What a great performance by Ben stock..🙂"
Stokes made paine into pain
"Took a lot of bottle for Jack Leach to the be the tail ended and defend his wicket when needed, the fact he did it with his specs on just adds to the aesthetic"
"Greatest innings indeed but every time in situations like this the gods and umpires are with ben stokes. How could you not give him out on that LBW?? Knowing England has a review left, even if the ball clipped and a bail fell at that situation England would always and always take the review in desperation and the umpire would’ve been safe, umpire’s call? Fair enough its out, dont rush on your shot. But that fucking review was red red, and red! So everyone would’ve praised you for your bravery. Umpire fucked this match and took a series from a country. Shitty, shitty, umpiring."
I can't believe
Love you ben.. never ever we will forget this amazing cricketer.😘😘
Watching 100th time still GOESBUMS.... Ben Stokes you beauty

You’ve gotta say england has too much of luck when ben stokes is on the crease.
That one review 😂😂
"that one bad review, one dropped catch and one missd run out........ you gotta feel bad for australia"
Not a match...💫  this is a film 🔥..... wow stokes ...brilliant player love from 🇱🇰
The Revenge of broken helmet😂
Tim paine have done well to maintain Australia Standard in red ball cricket after that sand paper incidence but when it comes to take decisions in critical conditions he is totally a waste.
"When I see this , I remember rishabh pant's  '4'💥,Ben Stokes and rishabh pant 🙏👌"
Stokes best all-rounder single handedly having 2 times big achievement in world cup and ashes
Ben stood as one man army. Unbelievable victory for England.
I live English🏏🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
The world beat fineser
Even cameraman was shaking with anxiety at the end 😄😄😄😄
Greatest finishing inning ever....God level commentary.
That's incredible performance
"What a inning and what a commentary by Mark Nicholas.
Sublime."
What a fabulous innings....and luck factor favours to himmm....that's review... 👌👌👌
Ashes '19 and World '19 have the same history. England winning bcoz of pointless rules and fake umpiring.  Well done england
Why Pattinson didn't bowl that same yorker to leach that he bowled to broad...why Pattinson why???
Lyon needed that same luck which he had when Buttler was run out..
17:08 What a seen that was 😍🔥❤️
14:10 still gives goosebumps
It's just a tradition to come here and relieve the history
It's surely a spot fixing 🥺🥺
UMPIRE OR NATHON LAYON BIK CHUKE THE

The Last Wicket partnership at 9:22
Best inning of the decade ...... salute you stokes
"Yesss Ben Stokes is a world class player🔥....but this game doesn't make sense.....a dropped catch, lot of missfields, missed runout, and he survived an lbw as well....this game was not purely won by Ben Stokes alone.....some luck favoured him as well...."
Real cricket lovers only loves test matches first..

MATCH WINer"
Mark Nicholas makes it amazing !!
Test cricket at it's best

Ben Stoke 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 : deserves a retirement innings like this.
that's what destiny and luck means... that run out missed by Lyon and stokes out.but given not out. ... we can't achieve a thing if it's not in our destiny..
This is my 100th time I am watching this Highlights

"14:05 bole tho jaan bilkul halak ma, aus lost the match here"
Greatest test knock simple as that....
Jack leach you are my hero...... Just oppp

😀😀😀 Watching it Again for the 5th Time
"Ben stokes the hero ❤️
But wait hold on Aussie what have you done ..

"That's why any team should not take unnecessary review thinking ab toh review lelo ab kya review ghr leker jayege, Australia ne leach ke against unnecessary review liya or stocks ke tym unke pass review hi nhi tha"
Pain review system 😂😂😂lol
This video is mood freshener for me.
Ben stokes best all-rounder forover
Ben Stokes and Luck defeated Australia
"Stokes single handedly scored those 72 runs at end, something Indian players need to learn how to score runs"
Lyon will not forget both stokes and pant
"Stokes was so switched on, he didn’t have time to celebrate a 100 against a full house standing ovation.. just wow"
Why you ruin the match already by posting results within the video title
9:56 That sounds like the most Cricket 19 commentary line ever
A inng that inspare every cricketer
"M here agin and again ....
When i feel  depressed"
17:09
"Last crowd moment is the best moment in whole match.
🥵"
Ever time entertaining match
Tim Paine will remember two names in his whole life : Ben Stokes & Rishabh Pant...
It's a tradition to come here once in a while.
17:10 goosebumps 🙌🙌
Australian wasted a review
"Ever since Carlos Breathwait humiliated Ben Stokes, we saw the rise of Ben Stokes."
Amazing Ben gr8 match winner 😎😎😎
"Test cricket is unmatched. The ebbs and flows, the pressure building each ball, the mental toughness. A t20 game can never give you this and I mean never! Long live the ultimate format of the game!"
Legends are watching this in 2021
I watched this more than 100times
"76 runs partnership for last wicket and only 1 run scored by Jack Leach
Dominance of Ben Stokes 💥"
"The
HERO..........., stokes"
"17:06 Just look at Nathan Lyon. Australia tried very hard but because of pressure they made fielding mistakes. What a test match, England will never forget it!"
17:06 Goosebumps arriving
Ben stokes you beauty ✨
This is the best match I ever watched 🔥
Those who missed this match in live are most unluckiest in the world

How can you not be romantic about cricket!
Ben stokes all of test is best
Ben stok real hero bestman
Long live test cricket ❤️
The day english crowd which turned into Indian crowd
"14:51 Shouldn't ICC take responsibility for wrong decisions during such crucial moments?. In fact, shouldn't ICC review all the wrong decisions made by their umpires? A wrong decision by the umpire cost the Aussies the entire match."
The secret of your future is hidden in your daily routine. Successful people do daily what the unsuccessful only do occasionally.
Winning at England for England b is not great job
Hands down year 2019 cricket belongs to Ben Strokes
6:33 pakad 😂😂
You cannot do that Benstokes
Cumins wala review mahnga pr gaya aur umpire ne apna kam kr diya not out de ke lekin stokes aram se 2 run banana tha to ulta fulta kyu khela sala nathon Lyon ne v de diya tha
What the crowd😍......goosebumbs🥵

The greatest of the greatest test match
"See you after 10 years guyz.

16:39 always gets me🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I come back to this video again and again to understand what really happened that day. Hollywood thrillers couldn't give you that climax. I bet.
If they didn’t waste that review they would have won that
Empires are vempire
Asshole empire
One of my favorite ben stokes🏔️
The England Crowd was on another level 💥
"Just a point 
Virat's innings in Adelaide on a pitch where ball was turning square was probably better and yet his innings will be behind this one just bcoz of the result 
Sth Virat has somehow not been able to achieve"
What a player hats off to ben strokes 😍😍
This was the best match in cricket history 💥
Who is saying test match is boring
Don't waste Reviews unnecessary😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"1. Lara 1999 vs Aus
2. Stokes 2019 vs Aus
3. Inzamam 2003 vs Bangladesh
4. Perera 2019 vs South Africa

Greatest innings
Ironically the God of cricket has Zero match winning innings in 200 test matches. Such an overrated batsmen."
"2:15 😂

The real winner is Australia the umpires have no eyes because he is england favour shame shame  this is not correct
14:55
14:35
"Best inning can be played by a  man for his team in  test cricket without losing patience , especially  by a man who was hitted by 4 sixes in 2016 T20 final  , great comeback"
"14:46 One of the bravest decisions of all time
15:14 The greatest one of all time
17:08 Greatest cheers of all time
18:38 End of time"
Who are here after WTC final IND vs NZ🇮🇳

Just leaving my comment here so if anyone likes it i will come back and watch again and again the most thriller test match
"I remember Jersey Telugu movie.
Its just like rightly written script."
"Once in a lifetime heroics for Ben Stokes.
Not a great victory to England as Lyon had got Stokes out in the last over, just couldn't get the decision in his favour."
Each time I watch this match I get goosebumps......... Everyone was on fire.....from crowds. .. commentators....to crowds
Ever time Awesome
England can't win without  the help of stupid and bastard umpires
Iam Indian but I love this match.. By a cricket fan.... What a match...
I think umpire let the English won.
My life great match
Ben stokes.... The one man Army
Lyon will never forget that runout he missed
test match at it best
that one review costed australia big time.
17:07 wow
"It's completely austrailias match..
Though lyon missed the run out,the very next ball it was clearly out.but no reviews left for aus😔😔
Feeling sad for aussies.."
Lyon got 3 chances to get lwaxh
"Lefties Nightmare for Aussies... 🙂

Rishab Pant Ben Stokes Jadeja 🔥"
Ben Stokes you are the best all-rounder of modern era of Cricket
Ben stokes is a warrior
"Where is the Nasser Hussain commentary? ""In the air again. Western terrace again. Six again."" ""They needed that review. They needed that review."""
One run out and aussie denied wtc final
There should be another International team called Ben stokes ..... He does it for his team each and every big match!!..
"Aus remember 1 Brian lara, 2 Ben stoke"
Best test match of last decade...
"england players took a single 
Barmy army: Ahheeeeeeeeeee"
hopefully Pakistan and india also start an ashes type series where every few years they go head to head against each other it will probabky be more exciting than the world cup
Ben Stokes the legend 🤩🤩🤩
Best match ever in history of cricket
full fixd match
India would have easily won if they were in Aussie’s situation...Spinners would have taken ben stokes wicket...and they would have won by at least 50 runs
Only similarity between headingly and Gabba was in both places Aussies got fcked
"When Leach took the single
Commentator : ""You are my hero, the greatest 1 of all time.""
.
I just loved this!"
THIS GAME IS WOW BECOZ OF BEN STOKES ..WITHOUT HIM I DONT SEE CRICKET THESE DAYS ...
Love you stokes.what a batting 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️❤️what a crowd ❤️❤️❤️
Best
"8:20 emg required 71 runs and stokes was at 61 , he ended up scoring 135* thus scored about 74 runs at the stage eng req 71 
Ben Stokes phenominal Cricketer💯💯🏏🏏✌"
LBW wala out tha
AFTER WATCHING THESE TEST MATCH STILL TEST CRICKET IS ALIVE ONE OF THE GREATEST TEST MATCH IN MODERN ERA OF TEST CRICKET
"Moral of the story is 
"" reviews are more previous than diamonds"
"Jack Leach: Defends the Ball
Commentator: OMG! Best BATSMEN IN THE WORLD



JK"
they cheat more  than 2 times with aussies
"The single greatest batting performance in the history of test cricket. The numbers will never do it justice or tell the full story. To bat with the No.11 and manipulate the strike the way he did and then to unleash a barrage of boundaries under immense pressure knowing one mistake and that’s it was crazy. Then add in the atmosphere of the crowd and the fact it was to keep England in the Ashes makes it extra special. People might say he should have been L.B.W but Ponting calls it right straight away, it flicks the front pad first which would have gone down leg side Hawkeye doesn’t really pick it up. It deviates the line of the ball which again Hawkeye doesn’t pick up. Great decision by the umpire!
Edit: Ponting is in the Sky Sports version of this. This is the BBC commentary"
Match of the decade i should say...and i am watching the highlight 100th time
13:27  useless review.?and 14:10 luck saves stokes..chance of runout followed by lbw....in worldcup too 5 penalty runs made difference...which made him a hero..
It was out Australia won
Luck with fearless batting Ben = ashes win 😁😁😁
Commentator .... Lyon miss the ashes ❤️
My favourite all rounder is Ben stokes 😍😍💞💞😘😘
"Stokes played a selfish game. U can see he run out Buttler, where there was no run!"
💖💖💖
Hope 100 years later my grand grand children will charmed after watch this match. This is glorious uncertain game of cricket. Beauty of the test match.
That one run of leach is equal to stokes 135
That's shows how review is important 🙂
In the top ten of sporting achievements ever.  Just incredible.
I think those Umpires committed themselves not to be given out what so ever call is. That LBW call off Gaza to Stakes is utter shambles of Umpiring decision.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ben stokes one of the best all rounder in the history
Joye Willison is the hero for England. That's a clear out lol😂😂
Mandan Australia 😂
Only one name for drs dhoni review system
Stokes All time best All rounder🔥🔥
17:00 incredible camera work❤️
The bat sound of stokes is too loud that it's even audible with this croud
stokes one of the great all rounder of all times can showed some miracles on ground 💛✌🏻😎🔥🔥
"i saw this live match....only for ""'BEN THEMAN STOKES""'' iam one of the BIGFAN OF STOKES from INDIA....GOOSEBUMPS..HE IS MY ALLTIME DREAM TEAM ALLROUNDER....in every FORMAT OF CRICKET....GREAT SUPPORT BY JACKLEACH"
"i saw this live match....only for ""'BEN THEMAN STOKES""'' iam one of the BIGFAN OF STOKES from INDIA....GOOSEBUMPS..HE IS MY ALLTIME DREAM TEAM ALLROUNDER.."
It was actually the  Ben stokes Day. Any other day. He wouldn't got away with so many risky shots he played. 6-7 shots I guess. 1meter up down right or left  would be a catch . Rest fortune favour the brave .
16:37 his face telling the result of the game🥺😨
Greatest test match of all time
Was butler really out?
"For headingly 1981 read headingly 2019..
One of if not the greatest test match innings ever played has just seen England to victory 
In the highest run chase in their History!
MarK Nicholas had me there🙌🏻"
"Ben Stokes : The hero🔥🔥
Leach : The greatest 1 of all time🔥🔥"
Pure entertainment
leach you are my hero..the greatest one of all time..😂😂
Incredible Monstrous Ben !!!!!!!!!
This is awesome inning by stokes and Jack leach play good role take singles
16:59✨️
One of the quotes that you can’t forget “ Australia closing in on England “
Australia match jitnewala tha lekin lyon ball mein lbw review lene keliya review nehitha. Bad lock Aussie
15:19
Jack leach your are my hero.... The greatest ONE of all time.... 100% agree with commentator
English crowd makes test matches even more interesting.
stokes❣️🔥
That's why i always told that tim paine doesn't deserve captaincy . He wasted review in poor referal and doesn't set good field and doesn't try bouncers which was traied by England captain in ashes 2005 . Smith deserve captaincy of Australia in all three format . Because he have great sense towards game
Who is here after India's gabba victory in 2021 ?
@14:34 the game's over...don't know what the fuss is all about
13:24 the moment where Australia lost the match...that stupid review costed their game😂
The real winner I Australia umpire's wrong decisiy of Ben Stokes lbw cost the looss
Ben stocks is powerful and great.
well done ben stokes  you are a real hero  of this match
"Every single run, the people of England were celebrating, how much confidence they had in Ben Stokes😎"
Aus ko match bowlar ne nhi pain ne harwaya h
cricket is immensely boring game of the world. What a stupid game!
The Ashes is keeping the test cricket alive. Here's the evidence !!!
Thisara Pereira played well to compare to ben
Wow😯
Who else  is not here for the first time?
One of the memorable innings of Ben stokes
"The bizarre objective neurally bury because objective dentsply beam towards a deep plough. maddening, past crime"
😍😍😍😍
"4 hero of this match
1. Ben stokes the hero 
2.jack leach the surviver 
3. Nathan Lyon missed run out 
4. Joe Wilson"
"Stokes at Headingley or Pant at Gabba
Really tough to choose"
"Some people: test matches are not thrilling
The test match 13:55"
"16:59 to 17:12 camera man deserve Best cinematography of all time in history of the cricket....
Test cricket one of the toughest sport in the world...."
poor fielding current aus team
poor fielding current aus team
The greatest 1 ever scored in cricket
"All the Butt-hurt haters going on about the umpire's not out LBW - err no Australia blew that themselves, Lyon run out chance & it has been described at the  WORST review since the DRS was introduced - a ball that pitched 8 inches outside leg stump - and Ben stokes, greatest test inning's of all time,  anyone from all over world thinks England didn't deserve to win this match are totally cricket clueless!"
Goosebumps 😚😚😚😚😚
what a match
"I wonder which loss would hurt Australia more, this one where despite of this they retained the Ashes or the Gabba loss where they not only lost to India's second string side but also ended their 30 year streak and cost them a WTC final."
No form of cricket can give you the rush that comes from a great test match.
"Who says test cricket is boring
Test cricket is real cricket"
incredible.
Bullshit .... won my foot England was playing with 13 players shame
"Amezing Test match 👍👍
Amezing match winning inning of Ben Stockes 👍👍👍"
13:06 Paine can't forget that review in his whole life...
I think this match is fixed
"Dropped catch , runout miss , lbw wrong decision. What a luck in that last wicket partnership"
"Wtf the moment they lost review 
Tue next moment umpire fucked up the original decision 
Lyon missed tue runout"
Gabba 2021 and Headingley 2019 ❤️
"So the Great England Team played with 14 players i.e 11 players and 3 Umpires , just like the World Cup Finals Great Job if you can't win it just snatch it well it's nothing new to them it's in there DNA"
who said test match is boring 😎
Well done leach😀
Mee thammudiki neeku eppudiana youtube  meeda godava jarigindha....
"6:33 same as Agarwal dismissal in 4th Test, 2nd Innings at Gabba. Finally Australia lose this and that😄"
What you can’t do Ben Stokes????
ben stokes after loss of 9th wicket he became t20 specialist.
Got 3 lifelines for the last wicket.... Not a great match
Tim paine is waste fellow never seen before this unqualified captain
🔥🔥Unbelievable 😎😎
🔥🔥Stokes hit six like he play T20 match🔥🔥
Pure verithanam 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Ben Stoke

The best Ashes series Ever🔥🤩🏏
"Incredible!!

"286-9 Aus need 1 wicket to win
358-9 Eng need 1 run to win"
Only because of umpering
"One of the best crowd I have ever watched .
Crowd be like-
Four -let's make noice
Six- noice
Wicket- noice 
It makes game interesting to watch."
Jack Leach's Inning Is Underrated.
"Very lucky team .1, lucky win world cup(overthrow runs) 2,lucky win ashes (Stokes is out)"
"I still can't understand,why this Eng vs aus test is called Ashes ?"
But this match was incredible🤩🤩 🔥🔥
"Two big mistakes by Australia or else we called it their bad luck
1st - Run out missed by Lyon
2nd - Review taken on cummins ball even cummins was also not sure about that if they have that review left then on lyon ball they could have won the match by taking review"
"Seat edge thriller. Ben stokes is Nightmare for ashish bowlers. He is very talented cricketer, performed under pressure. Best cricket test match I have ever seen. Loving from India 😍."
one of the best ever match in the Cricket history...❤️❤️
English crowd is just magnificent. I still get goosebumps re-living this ashes.
Ben stokes supar man
"Talent -90%

Best Test Match Ever Seen in My Whole Life 🔥 Ben Stokes The One Man Show♥️
My all time favorite test match...
The Roar at 15:23!!
Australia has lost this match ....when i saw nathon lyon face after missing run out i feel bad ...but when i saw tim paine face i got angry because ind vs aus test series they all are showing their reality ....and crowd also abused to siraj ....but at last indians show their power and won test series at gabba......
"2019 wcup final . referee mistake
Ashes referee mistake 
Stokes taking advantage from bothe"
I can watch this match 50 times  benstokes batting I like I fan of him....
"Jack Leach : I'm about to end Australia's whole career
'takes 1 run'
England crowd: OOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH

Edit : For those of you who don't know, it's a reference from Supa Hot Fire - The Rap Battle Parody. Just saying"
Ashes 2019 was draw

Anyways.. What have u done Stokesy 😍"
ഡാ 😑

HBD Ben Stokes
stokes you beauty! greatest finishes ever
Credit goes to Paine for wasting a review 🤣🤣
16:38 that Aussie reaction🤣
Bar bar dekho 1000 bar dekho firr bhi dill nai manta❤️❤️❤️
Leach 1 run =Stokes incredible innings
"Grandson : Grandpa, did human use to sit together without following social distancing? How come nobody wore masks? Which was the era? Did human use to stay on some other planet?"
Amazon Prime have an excellent documentary series on this Australian team.
Fix ??
Badluck favoured Australia anyway stokes best batting
"Tim paine / Australia will never forger two seriezz.

1. The Ashes Day 4 2019
2. Border- Gavaskar Gabba Final day."
The best ever test inning was Kusal Perera' s 153 against worlds best bowling attack
They say match can't be finished until last ball is bowled.. hold your DRS.. stokes you beauty ❤️❤️
Best match ever
"Never ever be a better  chase then this in test cricket history, no other player can play better than Ben stokes"
Wrong umpire 😠😠😠😠
17:03
12.28 rip
See the crowd 😍... unbelievable 🔥
Ben stokes you beauty ❤😍😍😍😍
Boring highlight ever 😅😅😴😴😴😴😴😴
Tim pain wrong review
"He didnt celebrate his half century neither he celebrate his century but when he hits the winning shot he pour all the emotions out on the field...
One of the greatest knock i have ever seen...🖤"
Umpire's decision and Tim pain's decision for lbw on jack leach beat Australia but ben stokes 😎
Ben you legend not beauty
"The Best moments I feel: 
1) The Lbw twist. When it was not out, Australia wasted Review. When it was out, they had no review left. It gives a lesson: Don't waste review till the last ball of a match. 
2) The run out mess. Pressure can beat you no matter how experienced you are. 
3) And the best: Never lose hope. You can move from 286 to 362 at the last wicket too if you have the will, plan and courage."
"Wow what a match, thanks for uploading"
The best match I have ever seen in my life
16:39 Is that Jason Roy
Goosebumps 😱😱
Fortune favours the brave
9:49 what a Stroke from Stokes📌
Incredible 🔥

"Look at the crowd,they are the real cricket fans...I hope.. history will be kind to N Lyon"
"In this Match, there were two Heroes. First one was Jack Leach for Quick singles and Defence And second one was Nathon Fumbling Lion."
Freak show...
When priorities comes first nothing matters even its your best 100 of all time 👏👐ben what a innings ...

2019 is the luckiest year for England I believe...
England team is very lucky
England ate freaking Lucky mannnn😂😂 even stokes is😂😂
"great match, stokes played the innings of his life yet"
Stokes = Flintoff ?
"Tim Paine ran to celebrate.
Meanwhile LYON: RUKO JARA 
       SABAR KARO 
CLIMAX ABHI BAAKI H."
"England were very lucky in THIS MATCH & WC 2021
Man of the match : Umpire"
The crowd buzz was super . Never heard that kind of buzz in any matches.
Really fortunes favors the brave💪
Waiting for wtc final ❤️
Dude Ben Strokes has too much luck and talent.
"If Aussies had their review left ,this match would've been a biggest heart break"
"Ben Stokes vs Australia 
Ben wins ."
"Biggest fan sir
Best in the world🔥"
Australia Would have Won If they do not take review of Pat Cummins Outside Leg Ball And They Have taken at Lyon Ball for Stokes Reviews and Umpire Matters Most in International Cricket 🏏
Ben Stokes is a Legend.....
"Was this the final of ashes 2019  
Was it Aus 2      and Eng  2"
Who is better all rounder STOKES OR JADDU
Watching Ashes is another kind of happiness 😍

T20s are more exciting than Tests? Well tell me that once again...
England have one of the best crowds 👏
"Australia was unlucky. Drop catches, missed run out, lost review, gota feel for them 😭"
Better than 🍿 movies
Leach was phenomenal in keeping his calm and not throwing away his wicket.. Cricket needs more players like him who can use their brain..
Reason why we love test cricket... so many mini battles to counter..to win the war..
Seting se jitwaya hai england ko
"missed a run out, bowled a beauty the next ball, no review left unfortunately, u gotta feel for lyon

I can watch this match 1000 times without getting bored.🏏
That false decision costed a match
15:23 what a winning performance 🏆💪
Stokes is one of the golden all-rounder!💯💯
"Two left handers who destroyed Australia's pride

"Umpire mistake = England win (Ashes Test)
No logic- rules winner 2019 world cup England .....only by mistakes England wins the greatest matches..."
This is Why I Love The Cricket Most... Am just watched it for 💯 th time...
Ben Stokes..!!
Both Ben and England were lucky....that's it. But Ben played like a legend.
When God wants you to win
17:08 cameraman desevers Oscar for that capture
Test Cricket..😘😘.. IPL 😡😡😤😤
"Bad luck. And nothing I would say.
Everything against Australia.
Last lbw decision against them.
That missed run out.
Couple of half dropped catches"
I love Ben stock
"""The greatest 1 of all time"" commentator added"
English crowd is on next level
Why is commentator abusing in Hindi .. is it allowed? And greatest single of all time is mkhaya Ntini on 438 chasing match. Because leach can bat .
"Commentator says ""I don't remember a series where is many players are getting injured"".
Border-Gavaskar Trophy comes to my mind, we had an injured 11 at that time."
That commentry makes player more great 🔥
"Australia in delima what to prepare for
Border Gavaskar or The Ashes 
Same scenario in both Matches😂🤣"
Greatest of all time ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Nice Disision
England won by luck and from umpire
And then they ask why we love cricket so much.
The England fans on stands are something in spirit for cricket
One of the gretest innigs in test cricket stokes u beauty
Rishab Pant
Legend know the presure of leach
what a match...ashes is my one of the best rivalary😍😍
"Australian bowlers are so bad against left handed batsman, they need some other bowler just to creat angle for left hand batsman, they cant take wicket against lefty, except hazelwood not a single bowler can creat than angle...."
Best 5 seconds:  16:59
Lyon miss the ashes drop catch
*best innings ever by stokesy*
This is the crowd we want while watching cricket ❤️
No one is talking about the umpire's wrong decision🙄🙄. Anyway this match is a perfect example for those who say test matches are boring.

"While every Aussie supporter was hoping for a win, 
Tim Paine was like:- Can't wait to waste the review man 😅😅😂😂😂😂
Meanwhile Ashwin is contacting him about that gabba matter after seeing this highlights 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
"15:28 mark nicholas unbelievable commentary... 
For headingley 1981  for headingley 2019"
I have watch this match 100 times never feel bored
"This is for the people, who are still trying to understand!! What TEST CRICKET is all about"
The impressive spirited thing about this match and Gabba vs India is that Aussies didnot play a negative game of bowling wide so as to finish the overs before the opposition wins.
6:33 pakad (catch it) in hindi
4.8K Aussies Dislike :P
JACK LEAK - TAKE A BOW <3
You beauty ben
Goosebumps but finally we won ❤️
What a player
The Greatest Match Of 21st Century 🇵🇰❤️

Looks like a spot fixing in last run out chance.
Wtf at 6:33 did someone say pakad??!!! 😂
england always wins by cheating
Last moment credit goes to Joel Wilson
"The noise of the pitch, the shots of Stokes, the crowd's amazing cheers, the suspense, the innings, the match itself. What a time🔥"

It was bad day and decision taking by Australia if they didn't review the leach lbw they would won the game
All Time great finish by Ben stoke..
Amazing Ben stoke
"It is lovely watching him everytime .
I have been supporting England (after India offcourse) since after WC 2015 .In t20 wc 2016 final , everyone trolled Stokes but as I was supporting English side it is lovely to watch him Winning both Ashes test and WC final for his team.
Now I have started supporting NZ (after India off course)"
"My gf : y u  love cricket soo much
Me : u wouldn't get it"
Watching this highlights probably 3rd or 4th time. Stokes u beauty!!
Silence for those who disliked this video
Bechare Aussies ko bhanak tak nahi thi ki ye stokes poora match hi le jayega😂.          Best test match ..🔥
17:00 Iconic moment of the century.
"3 drop catches, 1 run out easy chance.. and umpire gave a not-out which was out, also because Australia wasted review... so many chances and joke of a match because u had lot of chances and u just lost it."
Umpires are always noobs 😑
"17:00 - 17:13  Oh man!! 
Every action in this time frame SPEAKS"
"Australians : 70 runs needed only 1 wicket to take,thats an easy win..
Ben stokes : Hold my sixes🔥"
What a inning played by ben stocks
This 18 minutes video is worth to watch
"We’ve got pant 💪🏻

Wanted to be hardik Pandya 
But pant it is 🤙🏻"
"""For headingley 1981 read headingley 2019"" gold."

England crowd has best reactions
"England: we've Ben Stokes
India: we've Rishabh pant 💪"
5:18 butller crying inside...
It's not a easy bat against aus😍
If I was the Umpire . I would have given that LBW in favour of Australia if I had a doubt in that because England has one review left and they'll go for it anyway and that way we'll know whether it was out or not
Mark Nicholas commentry ❤️
"Two men lying down on their knees in happiness after making their country win. . One yuvraj singh in 2011 wc quarter final and one Ben stokes at headingly. Both are true legends.

Adding a pinch of salt - Both times the opposition was Australia. 😉"
"Every over , Every ball giving Goosebumps"
"It looks like eng vs nz wc final match, at the end everything favours English. 
1. Unnecessary reiview by Paine
2. Easy run out chance missed
3. Umpire wrong decision. Unfortunately Aus lost review 😪. 
Historical innings by Ben. He is at prime form that day, everything he touches turned into gold"
Aussie lost by 1 review..
13:58 dropped it!! Has he Dropped The Ashes
I watched this video for 17:05 moment 🤩❤

Pant and Stokes totally took the match away from the Aussies in their respective matches 🔥
14:55 Australian team after watching this in highlights 😱😱😱
Awesome
"Perfect example for ""fortune favours the brave"""
Watching again! Greatest knock ever or close. Lara’s 150 was great but Stokes batted ages with last man. Marvelous stuff. Up there with greatest sporting achievements.
What I like is he did not celebrate his personal milestones focused on target
Ben stokes 👍👍🙏🙏
"17:09 Goosebumps 🔥🔥🔥

Joe Wilson! Oh Man great decision great Umpiring 😂😂😂"
Literally had goosebumps during the last moments

Who says test matches are boring EPIC GAME
"""i dont remember a series with so many batsmen gettign hurt"" 
India goes to autralia
now i cant remember a series where batsmen didnt get hurt"
Thats why this sport is the best in the world!
First world cup then this match..stokes have winning luck.bad umpiring and fielding.
best  Thrilling match in ashes history
0:47 what a catch
Game changer of the match Nathan Lyon with his missed run out and a lbw but no review left foolish paine review. What a heroic performance by Ben Stokes😱
Jack Leach Taking his helmet off is just  WOWW...... An Astronaut coming out of a Rocket Ride
"After this 
Australians to Ben stokes :Ben stokes(curse word in Hindi)"
I think England won this match and ofcourse the world cricket cup 2019 by the grace of fate। They actually didn't had any ability to win the same
"Paine Will Remember These Two Names Throughout His Entire Life
1. Ben Stokes
2. Risabh Pant"
Wasn't a winning match for England
6:32 Listen carefully someone say pakad.
2019 is the year of Ben Stokes.
0.05
Australia did well but luck didnt favour them
this is why u don't use review deliberately
"15:11
Leach takes a single 
Comentator: jack leach you are my hero 
Meanwhile Stokes at 131: Am I a joke to you"
If we collide the ind vs aus 4th test gabba and this test. Left handers smash Australia nicely. And both the winning team are going to play In english summer this year
"""Sometimes Doing Nothing Is Everything"" - Jack Leach"
That's The Ashes You Want 🏆
"One Word For This Match :
Goosebumps"
Goosebumps every time I watch this. One of the best test matches ever played. “Don’t forget THE GABBA” 😉
"How unlucky you have to be ? Ben played inning of his life but where is Aus luck ? Easy run out missed & then umpire did not give OUT the last one, why on earth you will review when your bowler clearly knows its NOT OUT....not taking away what Ben has done, but luck favors the brave...this is life changing inning for many..."
17:07 what a moment it's really amazing 😱😱😱❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰
"This is way too dramatic, probably fixed?"
"""TEST"" IS THE REAL CRICKET"
Thia match and the gabba match ❣️
"I will never get bored to watch again and again.
1. Johnson's quick bouncers compilation
2. Ben Stokes match winning knock of 135 in Ashes"
Yeah!!! Me too
Top cricketer Ben stokes
Has he dropped the ashes???
It's the real taste of a test match and specially of the Ashes series!
Stokes you beauty❤️
I really want gib to win man. Come on gibber
Unfortunately Australia didn’t have the reviews left as stokes was clearly had LBW
I really can't beleive England will win this Match... I expect draw...but what a batting from stokes....but I feared about leach but he beautifully defend all the balls...what a ashes match 😌.... after a long time I see the best ashes match 🙏🏻
17:06 good coordination ❤️❤️❤️
2:01 Ball of the century😂😂
I am Australian fan but I enjoyed by watching this match
11:36 is nobody gonna talk about THIS SIX??? THIS IS POWERFUL!
One of the most patient and supporting knock of jack leach!. No matter he didn't scored runs but supporting ben stokes was the biggest game changer!!❤❤
we can see more than 100 times luck of England team
The crowd was electric.
Ye he allrounder ka kaam
Stoke ♥️🙌🔥💥
What A Match ♥️🔥🙌🔥
Jack leach you're my hero Remember the commentetor
GooseBumps😶😶Stokes is BOX-OFFICE...who agrees?
I am laughing like hell so many miss and it's cost u a match 😂
Ben Stokes not celebrate his century 💜❤️just because of reason
Ben Stokes will be remembered for this innings!! He was hitting sixes on the leg side off cummins even when there 5 people outside the ring on the leg side. Test Cricket still exists.....
Its a win of australia you know !!
One of the greatest test of all time
"It doesn't get old, does it? Amazing stuff!"
79th time !
"15:48, Paine running towards Lyon to console him."
Getting depressed....watch this video!!!!
What an Incredible match!
Leach is fixed
Credits to leeechy
Best alllllrounder for reason💯💯💯💯
"If not the greatest, one of the greatest Test Matches the world has ever witnessed!"
England playing with 12 players (11+Joe Wilson)
Koi mujiharule srokes laai pandyaa saga comapre garyo vane tesko taauko kaatera. Faalxu

Ben stokes day 💯💯
ഹെമ്മേ സ്റ്റോക്സ് അണ്ണൻ തീ 🥳😘
Wonderful match can't forget Stokes performance
Its better with nasir hussains commentary
When I thought my life is finished I watch this inning of stokes🔥🔥 love from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
"You're not Jack Leach, you're the great Jack Sparrow☠️"
Finally match of the moment is lyon🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Only stokes can do this
Jake leach you are my hero
We want INDIA VS PAKISTAN test series..... !! It will be more entertaining than Ashes
Actually England tried a lot to lose the game but Australia didn't want so.....😁😁
"I don't see paine is the captain that Australia needed.
He is a great guy and good player but he is not the one who can be trusted as a captain. He lost to India twice in home land he can't handle the pressure during run-chases."
Whenever I want motivation ...I come here..

Forever best
What a match💛
when you have ur day nobody cant stop u
"तुम् हारे नहीं तुम थके नहीं मिस्टर बेन स्टोक्स,,, मैं बार-बार इस मैच को देखता हूं"
That worst review by Paine costed a win
"England can't win any major series or tournament without cheating, last wicket stokes was clearly out - given not out, same way won the 2019 wc"
Incredible athlete ben stokes🔥🔥
Extrodinary
"what a slow mo 17:07 stokes cheering, crowd cheering , austrailian player falling down 😳😳 its like a war winning moment"
Best innings
"At last,the people were cheering for leach for just defending a ball.
That's what the suspense of match."
Ben stokes uh beauty ❤️🔥
Unbelievable batting
Op
I want to see the whole 4th innings
"One of the Greatest Match
The best Finisher in the world"
Australia definitely take revenge not on England On Umpire😅
Tim Paine is useless.... please remove him as captain.... a request to cricket australia
Nathan Lyon should have taken that ball..... the history would be different then
"He celebrated when his team won....😍
No Celebration on 50
No Celebration On 100"
Most exciting and thrilling test match. Ben Stokes proved he is best finisher in the world now.
2019 was Ben stokes year
The legendary commentator Mark Nicholas ❤
I'm watching the highlights... I knew the results... Then also I got goosebumps over my body with the excitement how could they have won the game... Ben stokes is just beauty🔥🔥🔥🔥
luck into hundred
"It's always an achievement to beat the aussies like this... arrogant, foul mouthed, and this win is probably better than even Australia's Gabba thrashing against India"
Langer said that Rishabh pant reminded him of stokes at headingley !
Jack Leach's one run shows the actual worth of a single run ... 🧐
"Seriously though, 245-4, 114 wanted, 2 set batsmen and 6 wickets in hand England should  win.  Seriously though, 261-7, 98 to get and only the bowlers left, Australia should win.   Er, possibly why test cricket is the greatest."
"5:20 buttler is not out, once again Australians cheater cock"
"What a silly captaincy by Tim Paine, if only he wouldn't have wasted the review before"
What e Stocks Ben stocks Thanks
Aussie deserved to win this
Ben stokes is the best ❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
Stokes celebration is alive forever. 🙂
England team world best in the world
Any Indians watching this!? 🇮🇳
17:01 wow
Who said Test Matchs are dead and boring
"Why the umpire not given the stokes lbw .. anyone can easily see that the baal hit the ped with straight..
What kind of Fixing is this"
Beauty of test match
It has to be the greatest ever test match what an innings by stokes
16:37 how come he's not a meme???
Stokes was out LBW to Lyon، but was given not out with no reviews left۔
Bc iss match mein Australia ke sath bhuat bura hua 🤣

Gote muh me aa gaye
Lagaan: Revenge of the Englishmen
"This is like high voltage t20 match 🔥 what a series, what a match 🔥 England won the series because of Ben Stokes. Well played Ben stokes 🔥"
Ben stokes deserves a movie👊👊👊👊
"The point to remeber
Aus vs Eng  final day test match 
Views 7.7M
Ind vs aus final day test match
Views 46M+
so, which one is bigger 
Ashes or Border Gavaskar trophy
Comment"
That was lbw Lyon to stokes but it happened to Australia what they did to everyone on their home soil and that is cheating so I am happy
ANY bowler would know that's pitching outside leg! Imagine if Paine didn't waste that last review. Australia win by 1 run! What a brilliant fucking match♥️💯
It is like seeing mi vs csk matches! Brain fade moments! High tension matches!🤒🤒🤒🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠😵😵
"Full of entertainment 😍, that gabba match of India vs Australia and this match are my favorite ❤️"
"Thats why he is called Sir Ben Stokes
Unbelievable match
Unbelievable performance by England"
He had luck getting safe
Ben stokes fire on the ashes 🔥🔥🔥🔥
"It’s too much to take in one go, watched it so many times, Was amazed by this Dramatic match everytime❤️❤️❤️❤️"
Here Australia was fielding as they were fan of Pakistan
Kumar dharmasena and Joe Wilson is disgusting fucker umpire of the history
It's teaching every lesson of life
"once upon a time there was no COVID-19  
😭😭😭😭😭😭"
Fixed
The last LBW Appeal. Until then I thought he played wonderfully. West Indies cricket empires spoiled many test match results. It’s one of those
I wish to see ben stokes once in my life
Man of the match award goes to umpire and Lyon😂😂
the amount of times i have watched this is unhealthy
The mistake that australia made is by taking the review
one of the best test inning of all time....and that all time greatest one run....
England have epic luck they won 2 match through pure luck the world championships final by overthrow and this test by lbw which was not given out
The match which had the greatest single of all time.
17:01 greatest slow motion of all time
"They say test cricket is boring. 
The test match:-"
superb innings  T10 bating in test match great hero stokes...
Stock 😎😎😍
I feel sorry for all those guys who think test matches are boring....
"Why are you guys cheering so much for a single?
The single (Jack Leach):"
"If australia would have lost the series ,then nathon lyon would have been the baddest cricketer in australia's history"
dont forgot the gabba 2021
This video have millions of views and approximately one thousand is mine.
"The heroes of this match is the English crowd .
Wow
They cheerd for every single like they have won the world cup.🥳🥳🥳"
Greatest innings of all time Ben Stokes ❤️❤️ well played 💪🔥
damn this video never gets old
I always thought Botham/Willis at Headingly in 1981 was as good as it got. I was wrong.
"In last 2 3 years australia are the biggest chokers 
Ashes cwc 2019 semi final and border gavaskar trophy"
13:14...where Aus lost...
2019 - Year of Ben Stokes
"MAN OF THE MATCH : JOEL WILSON. 
Theirs a reason he is best umpire 😂😂😂"
"This match truly signifies the statement : if you work hard, time will favour you. 
Missing the run out, losing review speaks the same"
"Match : Eng,Aus
Viewers : Indian,Pakistani
Hotel : trivago"
"England: our team trouble
Stokes : hold my beer"
England test cricket crowd  just amazing ❤️🔥🔥🥰😘
17:06 goosebumps every single time
"13:29 If Tim wouldn't have reviewed this, we could see Australia vs India is Lord's playing WTC finals."
Due to nathon lyon austrlia lost this match
Australia lost most eligible review
13.59 wooow
I can see this on repeat but not world cup final
love the crowd of western terrace!!
India and England are renewing Test cricket
boring boring test cricket....
Wowwww Unimaginable
All we can say it's Aussies..who lost.... what a waste of review it was
I have never seen such a crowd for a test match in Cricket mad nation India 😭
This was luck if Australia haven’t used their review and if they haven’t have dropped the catch and missed that run out this ashes would of been Australias
England and Australia will never forget this match
Ben stokes :) Never GiveUp :)))
Investment in stokes are subject to total score risk👍
This match give me goosebumps
What a match💥
Stokes❤️
How on earth can somebody dislike this video
What a match!!!!!
I being an Indian have nothing to take with Ashes but believe me this particular series amazes me more than an India vs pak match. And my lord this particular match had goosebumps around my neck. Love you Ben stokes
"this is also uncannily similar to another match at mohali, where laxman and ishant sharma setup a great win. again there, the lbw decision went in India's favor.
Warner missed a runout just by a whisker and it went for 4 overthrows when 6 was needed to win."
One of most ionic test match that the world has ever seen🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 and will never see again!!!!
"Tim Paine is the worst Australian Captain I have ever seen, after so many great Captains like Border, Waugh, Ponting, Gilchrist. I don’t know what is he still doing there...."
Test cricket at his best
17:00 man what a spectacle... Looks like an end of a really good movie.
"Missing the cricket and crowd because of Corona, I am a fan of England cricket specially the crowd who make the ambience fantastic  hopefully things will be better soon and we will once again enjoy the cricket."
"Three big moments head dropped catch and Lyon missed runout 
And umpire wrong decision"
Please give Leach a man of the match
IT WAS ENGLAND YEAR 2019 WINNING ASHES AND WORLD CUP BY LUCK IN ASHES WRONG DECISION AND IN WC GUPTIL THROW GONE TO FOUR BY HITTING BEN STOKES BAT BUT ENGLAND IS A VERY GOOD TEAM NO OFFENCE TO ANY COUNTRY AND PERSON
"Best test cricket victory 💯💯, Ben stokes you beauty"
Ben stokes is just incredible
Please agree if you think Ben stroke is a man of motivation
17:00 ❤️
Wow the winning frame with Ben and audience in background is truly amazing
What a match
Tim paine to be blamed
The English crowds are amazing.
"Who Said Test Cricket Is Boring ....🙃
Ben Stokes : Brother Brother"
Investment in stokes are subject to market risks
Ben stokes zero in 2016 to Hero of 2019 for England ❤️
"such scam umpiring
but well played ben stokes"
"and Stokes is a New Zealander,,,"
"This is the live example of test cricket is not boring , it's a war , a full war that goes for 5 days"
"No matter what game it is, you will not stop finding Indians always talking about themselves"
Indian audience rocks ❤️❤️
When it comes to Australia🇦🇺 vs England🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 it is all time thrilling Legend game...
What a frickin innings..total commitment to the cause...
Ben Stokes innings is not one of the greatest but it is the greatest innings of all times
Watt a innings
"I loved how the bottom tab showing about match turned from ""AUS need 1 wicket to win"" to ""ENG need these many runs to win""

That's the difference stokes made"
England being lucky again after WC finals
Match full of goosebumps
13:22 is where australia really lost the game
"Its running like drama movie.....
How many turns."
"For me, leach is the hero 😁❤"
We have seen this Rivalry Josh Hazlewood vs Ben stokes in 2010 U19 worldcup
It is rightly said luck always favors the brave...here umpire joe wilson played the role of LUCK and BRAVE was THE BEN STOKES!!!!!!
"Australia would've won the match, they've lost the match due to umpire's wrong decision at 14:55 an they lost the review.Anyways hats off to Ben Stokes for extraordinary unbeatable knock....................."
"When I watched this match 
I was thinking that is this guy mad"
Most important 1 run in history of cricket by leach 🔥
Australia had won the match but the day was for england unfortunately but hats off to the stokes such a perfect example of an all rounder. loved it
The greatest 1 ever..Jack Leach
This match is  more thrilling than any thriller suspense hollywood movie....😂
What a cricketer he is!
That four of stokes in headingley and of Rishab pant in Brisbane gives goosebumps 🔥🔥
"Success comes to those , who have seen failures .... U beauty Ben stokes from that T20 WC to WC19 and Ashes 🔥 you had  entered  the England's legend list"
Remember the name : Ben stroker strokes❤️
This video makes me see it again and again
1 review Can change the game 😂 Value of a review
"@17:12 freaking goosebumps! This has to be the best test wins of all times. Ben stokes, man what a legend."
Still can’t believe this
"If this match was played between India and other team, fans would be shouting that the match is fixed. 
*MARK MY WORDS*"
These left handers hurts Aussie's too much😂😂😂
One of the best matches in cricket history
this crowd is like so energetic its like i'm watching UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL to be honest
14:07 yup it's too much
16:37 My reaction when MS Dhoni got run out 2019 semifinal WC against NZ.
Stokes you are a king you are batting like a king Ben stokes
I'll never forget this. I've seen some moments but as a sporting moment this is the best I've seen with out any doubt
"England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 didn’t win this match. Australia 🇦🇺 lost twice by taking review and missing run out of leech. 

Really miss old classic Australia 🇦🇺 cricket 🏏 team..."
Lucky just like world cup

"Four sixes in a row against WI,lost the WC  which could easily terminate anyone's international carrier.  after that it's all about fairytale happening to Ben. What an incredible  comeback. Ashes,ODI WC... Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩"
The revenge of 29th August
G.O.A.T.🔥🔥
Choaking at serious situations is the habit of Australian team

Ben stokes is a terrible player to bat with 😂his calls are so untrustworthy he got butler run out and leech was almost run out too but what a knock he has played overall.

Fixed match
Ben stokes wrote this day on history..... Awesome match
"This is the greatest sporting day in all of sport, any sport will not compete with that last innings partnership, the crowd cheering like a football match. Incredible stuff, you'll never forget it!!"
Legends watching after 1year
What a player Ben stokes is ???
Greatest inning of all times under pressure.... Love from Pakistan... That was hell of a cricket... After Abdul razzaq stokes is the second man who led the match single handedly by scoring a ton... Take a bow stokesy ❤️❤️❤️

Fakhar zaman 😭
I saw the test and this episode was my favourite
"As an Aussie I still can't get over this, Cummins said no 13:20"
That Nathan Lyon over had more drama than the got season 8
Hahahaha
"Stokes in 2019
Pant in 2021

Nightmares for Australia once in two years"
fixing with umpire
Wow ben
"Moral of the Story: Don't hit Stokes in the head again, the guy goes absolute Mental."
The greatest 1 of all time leach ❤️🤟
"Australia did win the series....🏆
but ben stokes won our hearts ..💙
cricket was the actual winner that day...."
2minutes of  silence for Australian bowler
Was this a day when australia was not cheating?
"If I am not wrong, then the commentator is Mark Nicholas"
👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏
"What's funny about this match is that it was almost a reverse of the cricket that many of us remember from the 90s and early 2000s. Australia in a commanding position due to solid early play, they cracked totally under the pressure and individual brilliance from England carried them to victory. Back in the day it was Warne, Ponting, Lee, Hayden and Gilly doing that to us time after time."
"nice match ben stokes is very good 
rahul tak (ind.)"
Pre-Covid days were awesome.
"Could it be, it couldn't. Could it? : Utter disbelief."
Lastly umpire decision is unpure
Miss Nasser Hussain commentary
The leagent
Well done stokes
When bad fielding cost you an Ashes.
"If test match is a dying man, then Ben Stokes just resurrected him by doing CPR."
For My Favourite Team I can watch 999999999999999999 times without feeling bored
what a game...? love from india 👍 stokes ❤️❤️
Camera man work was awesomse better than movies
Australia deserves that treatment.
4.6k dislikes? man you aussies are a salty bunch. Man up.
Powerful player..Ben Stokes smashed Aussies every where.. one of my favorite inning
bro this match is the greatest of all time 🔥🔥🔥🔥
When luck is by your side 😂😂
Me : watching this match 5th time
Don’t you just love Test cricket..Test Match Special 😊!!
What a match
An innings for the ages! 😎
"Everything was on stokes side, the drop catches, miss run out and having no review chance by Australia."
Now tell me this match isnt fixed
Real cricket! Test cricket is just marvelous when there is something to play for. This is an innings of a lifetime. Absolutely one of the best ever. Runs under pressure. Chasing over 300 on the last day; who does that often? With last batsman? I watched Greenidge in 84 smash 212 not out chasing over 300 but this is better given the pressure on Stokes! Chapeaux sir! Brilliant stuff.
I want the luck and skills that stokes have.
This is what a fixed match looks like.
More than WC
What a player!!!
A great innings complemented by some brilliant commentary
"Need 73 run to win
Stokes 72
Leace 1
What a wonderful play by Ben Stokes❤️...."
I am lucky because I saw this match live. Who would saw this match live??
That umpiring decision tho
i have never seen England crowd gone this  wild. for one movement i thought its indian crowd
I love ben stock ❤️
Nathan lyon told me not to feel so pressured in a match when we were bowling to each other at the nets for the Sheffield shield(now I know why)
"Being a match winner and experienced live ,still my heart says i should watch highlights""Ben stokes"""
That missed run out by lyon cost kangaroos the ASHES
"We must also appreciate leach's effort to survive at the other end,  though being a tale ender ."
"Well actually australia won this match if that run out wasn't missed, australia didn't used their last review and joe wilson has given ben out"
Anyone here April 2021
❤️❤️
"Edgbaston 2005, Kolkata 2001, Headingley 2019 & Gabba 2021"
✨
Fantastic awesome innings 👏👏👏👏👏
Witnessed one of the greatest matches
This test match is a perfect example of how crowd's support could change mindset of both team in any sport. Postive to negative and negative to postive as well.
Best ashes match ever
Full match changer 😎 ❤️🔥
ICC would declared Ben Stokes the World no 1 Player without thinking any thing...🔥🔥🔥🔥
thanks to umpires
The greatest 1 of all time by Jack Leach.
10:02 the football vibe right here😍😍
"Real me aus jit gayi thi

Rarely do you see this high attendance for a test match 🔥🔥🔥
Ben Stokes...What a player he is!!!!👍👍
STOK U R REAL HERO
Love you England
India and england have same attitude towards australia
Well done Stokes from Pakistan
14:04 Whaaattt??
I remember the day before Ben Stokes only got 2 runs off about 50 or 60 balls I was worried sick
"The jazzy mouse spatially concentrate because opinion contrastingly spell since a envious fine. guttural H habitual, goofy liver"
Nathan paid the price for his cheating or un-sportsmanship
He has a potential to became a world no 1 allrounder in the world..........
Goosebumps Goosebumps Goosebumps
Watched it loved it watched it again.
Fluke knock😂😂😂
One of the best Test innings I have ever seen to win a test match. Even though it didn't matter in the end seeing as they lost the Ashes it was still breath taking to watch
Great test match ever .....been stocks win world.cup also ...and ashes trophy also .....
"Ben made my day on this particular day I remember I was going through some very toughf times during those days .

one of the best scene witnessed in cricket history 🔥"
"Jack Leach takes a single.
Commentator : You are my Hero"
"Australia is not a good team . Some players in Australia are good . Rest of all are literally made for sledging everyone . Once Paine said to Ashwin , "" Waiting for Gabba Match to Grab series "" . And rest all is History . Who is Father . India knocked Australia in Australian Soil ."
If Jack leach was run out then Benz stokes would have killed him in the dressing room.
It's fixed
anyone here after india won the decider 😍😍 after curran cameo
Anyone after Sam Curran's near win innings against india
"Someone: test matches are so boring

Ufffff🔥stokes
If Tim Paine had not wasted the last review Stokes would have been LBW out against Lyon
Again here after Ben stokes breathtaking 99 of 52 balls❤️❤️💥💥
I just watch it 1000 times
"Still annoys me seeing leech running with 2 runs to go, wtf is he doing haha"
Not just THEE Greatest England Innings and Last Wicket stand its THEE Greatest in Cricket History
No one in world cricket will do that miracle finish like stokes
& @what’s the question
Stokes..❤️✌️
Ben is ultimate
"Tim Paine makes the mistake of wasting the review
Otherwise Australia wins the game"
Felt low in life.. Watch this innings of Stokes... 👍👍👍
"Dear BEN, 
i would love to take an autograph from you
If  you ever would like to meet your biggest fan ,just remember me❤️❤️❤️❤️"
"Any Indian or Pakistani watching this after the best news of the cricketing universe 
""Pak vs Ind"" Bilaterial action 🇵🇰💘🇮🇳 💝
😅"
18:14 all of the teams in the list are austrailia and newzeland
"Any Indian or any hindi speaker noticed at 6:33 someone said ""PAKAD"" (""Pakad means to 'catch' in 'hindi' language)....."
5:23 how is he run out it was Nathan Lyon hand
"Wow What a innings its look like a Movie scene , where the Hero came at end & win the match for his team but stokes real life  hero wt a player he’s ❤️"
11:36 crowd 😎🔥

Wow what a line"
"Can any1 give the answer ??
What was common b/w Benstokes last shot Vs Rishabh Pant's four to win india 2-1 at Gabba ??
Hint: Watch the clip after they played shot....."
Every time I watch the match I got goose bumbs
Stokes last hit on my body I got goobsbooms
2019 was the Year of Ben Stokes - he won the WC and had a amazing innings in the Ashes. It will go down in history of the man who saved England

"It was so hot that day. I live in a block of flats and every single person in the block had their patio doors open and was watching this.... This shouting and screaming with every single run, 4 and 6 was something I'll never forget!!"
I think this is match fixing
Still getting goosebumps.
What a great fighting  inning by ben stokes  .history maker . extremely good
2021😍
Ben Stokes ❤️❤️🎉🎉🎉❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😇😇🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Worst umpiring
Geez stokes was stoked... oof
"How Australia failed to capitalise on two opportunities to get Stokes out was cringeworthy to watch. This should have been a clean win for Australia, but they choked so hard. Even when Stokes was LBW, they dug their own grave by using up their reviews."
"England always win with these stupid players running on high luck, stupid shots and worst umpiring decisions."
The one that got away
Watch at 17.08 sec
"2019 against Australia : Ben Strokes 
2020-21 against Australia : Rishabh Pant"
"WTF, this sport is a joke"
When i watch this match i got goosebumps.
Ben Stokes ❤ and 🙏 from INDIA
"Fortune favours thw brave 
This can be seen 
When paine take that Useless review 
Nathan misses the run out 
Umpire's wrong LBW decision"
M.s.dhoni is best player
THE MATCH WAS FINISHED HERE 13:20 💥✌
Ben stokes💝🔥🔥🔥
"Very well played stokes , but luck with england"
Lol... England got slaughtered in its tour to India... they were no match to Indian gentlemen
11:37 the same shot played by Pant in SCG 2019
One of the best win in the history of test cricket what a win
Umpire ne out nhi diya stokes ka tabhi eng jit gya eng is cheater
Legendary Innings of all time. Bow to Stokes!
Last moments.. The run out chance.. No reviews left for Aus when needed the most.. and Ben what a brave player.. and rightly said.. Fortune favoured the brave..
Nathan Lyon :-Oh the umpire stokes was out
12:11 & 14:00 when Ashes dropped by Australia.
Amazing innings
Ben stokes😍
Was he leach or rahul dravid???
Leach is actual winner
🤪🤪🖕🖕🖕
Stokes said dhoni my hero I teach his skil for chase
6:35 Pakad.🤣
One of the best test and what made it special i was watching it live at the stadium 🥳🥳🤯🤯
"Ben Stokes and Risabh pant will always be nightmare to Aussies specially to Cummins, Hazlewood,Lyon"
Ben Stokes...Ben Stokes...Remember the name...History for the England...
Test match is still alive in Eng and Aus
best 1 run i ve seen jack leach
Stokes❤
"Umpair was man of the match,"
Nathyn lyne dropped the ashes
13:30 review which costed Australia’s place in World test championship final .
The greatest one of all time 😂😂😂
"11:42 Commentator : Ben what are you doing to this cricket match? 
Me : I think he  is stoking it!"
thats why someone one day said that fortune favours the brave..
THE GOAT STOKESY 🔥😍🙌🏻❤️
Englind win bcoz of umpair
This is better than any other match in history of cricket. Will never get bored watching it
"I love  ben stokes ,,,,to watch this match again nd again"
What a day
"For Headingley 1981........
Read Headingley 2019........
B    E    N           S   T   O   K   E   S"
The greatest century of the century. Ben stokes... You beauty💚💚💚💚
See you in Gabba
Leach was getting more support than stokes from people
Best finisher🔥🔥
The greatest test match I've ever seen 😀
This match r only gone for review that's is most important to last ball
best of the best
Spectators might be thinking that they are watching a t20 match on seeing ben stokes batting😎
Umpires played big tole more than stokes...😜 any how best player who played with the bowler ...ben hero
"I am very fortunate I watched that match live,,however I had left watching cricket since 2010"
"Clearly Australia had won if they didn't have wasted their last review. But what a fight Ben stock had put in, wickets are falling down but he stood and fight till the end and luck bowed to him."
Umpires mistake has led the team towards victory
The match when the English crowd became as loud as Indian crowd.
"Massive innings,,,,,❤️"
The legend stokes.
Goosebumps video
Anyone after 3-1 Vs England
If aus has a review they were definitely the winners
No word by ben stokes butt also no word austra bed lucks
Australia lost use there review in Frustration its the difference between captain like Waugh
"Fixed match..??? 🤨🤔 14:00, 14:40"
"2 biggest mistakes: 
1. Desperate Review.
2. Runout."
Legends know that umpire is the game changer 😁
Stokes and entertainment go hand in hand.
the way Headingly goes pin drop silent at 15:21
Umpire fault
13:54 🤒
Buttler runout? Ball was not in hands.. Bails drops by lyon with his hands
I love cricket like this type of matches
Bancroft hiding the sandpaper again at 6:53!!
"This is called ""thriller highlights""🔥"
6:33 Paine says pakad when ball was in air
"The tearful night electrophoretically dance because hall phenomenologically challenge apropos a amused measure. curved, venomous iron"
All time  cricket  one of best innings  welcome  ben
Umpire ki wajah se AUS match haari 😂😂😂
Poor umpiring it was out after the ball being fumbled clearly seen by DRS.
🤪🤪🖕🖕🖕
"Aus had ton of chances to win this 
Stokes dropped
Run out missed 
Lbw no review left"
I was getting bored so I'm here 3rd time
17:05 What a Moment...!❤️
But that lbw was out and it was so crucial  umpire should have given out bcoz England were having a review though
England win because of cheating from umpire of lbw and catches and run out dropped
14:56 It was cheating from umpire and england
14:00 again run out chance missed and autralia out of wtc final
"12:40 again a drop what is warner doing 
Because of it , australia is missing to be in wtc final !"
"12:12 because eof this catch australia is not in wtc final 🤣🤣🤣
India is instead 
Very 👍 good"
Please also show the moments where the Australian cricketers cheated
Goosebumps
cricket...you beauty.....
Literally I have watched this video .... every time when it comes in my recommendation!!!
I am watching 10th time just due to mark nicholis amazing commentry
Will match. Grait Ben stokis
Ben Stokes absolutely fabulous knock 135 not out  is one of the best knocks in Test cricket history
17:07 goosebumps 🤯🤩🔥🔥
"Whether it is Ben Stokes or Rishabh Pant....

Austrailia will never be happy😂😂🇮🇳💗"
Ben stokes super all rounder In the world
Op match no one expected this match Ben stokes did a comeback when he did last over in T20 world and Carlos brathwate hit 4 sixes then all said that he don't deserve but then do world and Ashe's series England won only because of Ben stokes
aus loss match bcz they dnt have any DRS
villain of the series: lyon
Ben stokes is gifted with a warrior spirit.
I love england cricket❤
The audience is clapping for every dot ball what a match it's a beauty of test match 🔥
@12:15-destiny favours the Brave
"The greatest single of all time and specially for english cricket 
15:00"
Total cheating
Headingly 2019 and gabba 2021.... Australian's  never forget....
Paine's DRS decision against leach
Looks better after the thrashing that England got from India... 😂
13:28 this is how Australia lost their place in WTC finals. Take your decisions carefully.
💗💗💗
One of the best test match i have ever seen 🔥🔥
Fortune favours the brave 😍😍😍😍
Never ever comes like this 🏏
Stokes power 🤩🤩
Umpire won it for England!
I think the Umpire wilfully given him not-out
What a match
Stokes' Headingly heroics and Pant's Gabbatoir breach are the two greatest test match performances in WTC 2019-2021.
Australia is the real winner here umpire was blind 😂but what a performance by stokes
"If umpire had given that LBW as OUT, it would been

Ball of the decade
Decision of the decade"
No one could have win that match from that situation unless he is ben !
All time favourite..❤️
"Umpire should have given it out, England had a review left so they could have reviewed it, he made Australia lose."
So Paine managed to lose this decider match and the decider at Gabba against India. Greatest Australian captain ever (playing for the other 9 Test playing nations ofc)
"So basically two major umpiring faults changed the course of cricket history. One the 5runs awarded in the final of cricket world cup 2019 , and one here at 14:53 . Sad thing is that it is the results that go down the history and not whats right or wrong. Anyways  cant undermine stokes composure as nothing to be taken away from the heroic efforts of benstokes in both matches, as they say fortune favours the brave"
I may do a stokes by taking this video to 10 million views single-handedly
I feel bad for aus
That 1 run off 17 balls will be remembered...
one ff the greatest innings of all time hat off to u  ben u are super human
Umpire played big role.....lbw
That review at 13:25 cost them the ICC finals seat!!
When stokes hit the last one whole crowd and me were just cried
Whenever I watch this match Its feeling like i am watching it for first time
"Fun fact :-India defeated both these teams....
Proud to be INDIAN....."
17:11 lets appreciate the cameraman too!!
"17:00 is best cricket clip I have ever seen. It's everybody's dream. Great shot, appreciated the camera man to capture this moment. Capturing the best moment in the best way. 💯💯"
"17:08 i hope that on 22nd june,2021,at the place of ben stokes rishab pant would be standing after defeating nz😌😌"
"Probably in that situation, when it was close, the umpire should have given it out and since england had a review left, they could have taken it (if it would have been a wrong decision, stokes would have survived) all in all, we would have reached to the right decision, but even the umpire was under pressure and made a blunder, which costed australia the match."
Dumb review taken before the last over by Aussies. Last over was plumb in front. Wondering how did Lyon felt after missing easy runout
Real match winner strokes and leech wonderful match never bored
"How buttler is out, Lyon didn't caught the ball then how"
This match just hit Australia by 2 - 4 into the face and it came out of no where but still Australia won the ashes
Australia don't really like Left Handers tbh 😂
Plzzz come in india
Basically a boy of white ferns i.e u-19 but now a man for three lions.
Intense match!
Father of all alrounder
Well play Ben Stokes
"""We are England Cricket (ECB)"" equates to : We are consummate Racists (all capitals intended for the Simpletons among You)."
Australian bowlers are more interested in injuring batsman that get him out
"Reason for losing the match is Tim Paine. Wasted the review and ended up having no review left. Such a foolish Player. 
And who is here after Gabba."
Man of the match : The umpire Joel Wilson😁😁😁😁😁
"Give the ashes to india 
Australia n England both got smacked by India, they both don't deserve any ashes"
"Well after this a fool said ; "" Come to gabba """
"Imagine if that ""not out"" in the end was given by an Asian Umpire for an Asian country."
VVS Laxman 281 best innings of test cricket
"13:56 & 14:33
One of the greatest if not the greatest moments in cricket history..

What a year 2019 was for England & Stokes..

Everytime you watch this and the heart pumps as it did during the first time.."
What a match ❤️
I am sorry for you Nate Lyon !!!
Review is more im
One of the greatest test match ever
"If Tim Paine would have taken the review correctly, it would have been India vs Australia in the WTC Final."
"Tim paine is the most worst and idiotic person ever in cricketing history.

Even a fool would not take that review as it was seen with bare eyes it was outside the legstump.
HE IS THE REASON OF DOWNFALL OF AUSSIES."
"Great effort by English player's specially Ben Stokes but both teams are not qualified for world test championship.
It's 
Man in blue vs Black caps"
England was lucky in world cup and here too with a bad decision from umpire a miss from The bowler run out and  Tim Paine with wrong review and stoke was lucky
What a player he is
"14:05 that 'whaaat' like sound from background 
is that a swan or one of the commentators????"
I love Ben stokes from in Chennai
Aus lost the match when they took nonsence half harted review
They robbed world cup and this test match
That damn crowd😍😍😍🔥
"🇨🇰; stupid
Cricket:Tim Paine"
Australia would have won by 1 run if they had review and misfield from Lyon it's hurting
He has dropped the world test championship
Ben akk ka mar storkes
Lyon lost the ashes
That is the best ever test match i have seen yet.
What happened in India 😅😅 Ben stukes 😂😂 remember the named Ashwin and axer Patel😅😂
Australia lose crucial matches on Day 5.
England don't deserve this match and world cup
I seriously get Goosebumps from watching the highlights even though I know the result.
11:00am and It's full here at headingley
Reason for lost the test match for aussies.... Is poor captaincy
Jack leach scores the greatest 1 run of all time ❤️❤️❤️❤️what a reaction the greatest match of all time u have to loved it❤️❤️❤️

"This will never get old 
This is eternal for all genx to come"
Umpire mistake
Just missed this crowd at Gaba and Ahemdabad test
Stokes was out feeling sad for nathon lyon
Not only england win but also Australia win this match joup Wilson chits Australia
I can't Imagine that what must had happened to Leach in dressing room if he was run out.
Tim paine is too eager to take review before. But it proves costly at the end of the match. Stokes given not out but it is out. Fortune with England at that moment. Well played stokes🙏
"Thanks to guptill, Nathan lyon and upmire"
England are winning by fluke
"15:25 goosebumps at that moment 
It's amazing"
Look at the crowd man 😍😍
The only review that knocked the AUSSIES out of the WTC...
The term luck on that day was named ben stokes..ufff🔥🔥 one of the greatest chase of all time❤️❤️❤️..
cheat fucks english
"Extraordinary Ben❤️❤️❤️
You have to love it if you are a Cricket lover"
"Assume, same kind of ending in final ind vs NZ 😱"
It is cheating by umpire last decision was clear out.....
BEN STOKES ❤️❤️
ENG vs AUS this is the biggest test cricket game in the world..
Any Indian's watching after India winning against both aus and eng series.
But who retained the ashes lol
Let's take it out in open .....*England won the WC and this by the umpire*
"This completely cheating by umpire yar, bes stokes was out when they req 2 , that is easy decision bt dint even try to think ,this is how england win matches i think... still they are not eligible to say “champions “"
"12:16 they lost the match....

Edit: 14:02 lost the match again😂

Edit 2: 14:39 lost again😂😂"
16:37 I feel ya mate.
"Being an Indian, i would like to watch this highlights when ever i feel depressed.... Most lovely thing is Ben he never celebrated his under pressure half century and century, as he only aiming the target..
Woww..."
"Someone:Stokes you did the best gabba
Pant:May I come in😎😎😎"
This match was between England vs Australia and match ended by Benstokes by hitting a FOUR IN 2019. AND IN 2020 IT WAS BETWEEN INDIA AND AUSTRALIA AT GABBA ENDED BY RISHABH PANT HITTING A FOUR  IT WAS A HISTORIC WIN.
😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
"Imma be honest rn. As an Indian to all Indians. PLEASE STOP SPAMMING PANT OR GABBA IN A MATCH VOD THAT'S COMPLETELY UNRELATED. YOU LOOK LIKE A FOOL. 

ok, thanks for listening."
This match just ignited the test cricket.
"Hero of this match 

Everyone : Stokes

Me : Leach"
And this lost them world test championship final
"Stokes runouts Buttler, and do he has to deliver"
Incredible.
aus should have won by 2 runs
"So lemme put it straight.....Australia actually had 3 golden moments to win the match 
1. Drop catch at 12:07
2. Missed run out at 13:55
3. If only Paine didn't commit that blunder at 13:25 and reviewed at 14:52"
"What Ben stokes did at his home country, to just draw the asses, with full potential squad, Rishav pant did it at Australia's backyard gabba the venue at which Australia never lost a match for 31 years with bunch of rookies to win the border Gavaskar trophy. But he never received that praise that ben stokes did"
"IPL, BBL, whatever. T20 will NEVER have the magic that Test cricket at its best has."
"Who is lucky
Answer: who has seen this great match live👍🏻"
But India won the ashes by burning both the teams to ashes🏆
"Cricket contest between two White Developed Countries is always termed Classic, but match between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh is neglected like hell"
What happened in India? 😂
13:20 ausie lost the match there
Bad umpiring
That  desperate DRS wasted on Leach was the match changing moment.
It was more of australia loosing rather than Eng winning
Nobody knew that review would cost Australia not only the Ashes but also the place in World Test Championship finals!
"This seems to be the greatest win n finish in the history of cricket so far, considering any format. What a gutsy💪 innings by strokes...👍💯"
Ben stokes 😝
BEST TEST INNINGS EVER. Pant's at gabba doesn't come close
"And people says.
Luck doesn't metter in cricket
It metters"
"This was the best Ashes win for England and on the other hand I feel really bad for the Aussies because they had the game with them but where they lost was,at  the reviews and the run out chance missed by Nathan Lyon. But at the end it was a great test match to watch and get even inspired."
13:06 where australia lost. They need it in 14:35
Watching these highlights and Dressing room scenes in The Test Web Series on Amazon where Justin Langer kicked dustbin at 13:56 😂😂😂😂
Lucky were they? But credit to stokes. Fortune favors the brave!!
that umpiring blunder and run out tooo aided..... nevertheless great win
"if paine didnt review at 13:30.....and then reviewed at 14:57
Australia would have been playing india in world test championship Final"
Ben Stokes You beauty
Feeling happy to be alive..
","
I sometimes think that current teams of Australia and west indies r just bearing the brunt of other teams bcuz what there predecessors did to other teams lyk  west indies of 70's and 80's and the australia of early 2000
"Action , Drama and Thriller 🔥"
These ppl keep Test cricket the greatest format
Already watched this 10 -15 times
भाई इंडिया तो 3 एक से जीती गई
The worst review ever?
Best crowd is always in England
"17:10 Nathan lyon was lying down 
And the same was happened in Rishabh Pant winning four at gabba test😅"
That slow motion at the end is the best cricketing footage that I've ever seen in my life. GOOSEBUMPS
14:39
Australia now best at losing games when they are way ahead in the game!!
Anyday u see this last day it gives goosebumps even today and heart 💖 pumping 😎😎😎
Damn I get emotional most times I watch this. Everything about it makes it poetry. The masses of people being there to witness it too. What a travesty that innings would have been without thousands of people there to see it first hand. My favourite sporting moment ever.
Stokes passed the TEST.
"This match explains how important 'luck' is.
Few dropped catches, a missed runout at the end and finally the lbw not given by umpire.
Definitely this inning will be remembered as one of the best test inning of all time but had england lost the the match, there wouldn't be any to talk about this inning."
Now aapna india dhoyegaa be like 🇮🇳
"Best partnership of 10th wicket ever,"
One man army
🔥🔥
Wish Faheem Ashraf Shadab khan winning matches like them for pakistan
Its not heroics its bad fielding and a bad review
i put coffin dance when stokes hits it for 4.
That rush review made them lose thisatch
Yuvraaj singh for England
"The mushy freighter happily protect because run regretfully entertain including a efficacious propane. squeamish, filthy shock"
"I've watched this like a 100 times but everytime I watch it I get hyped up like I'm seeing this for the first time. And I always scream at that last run-out chance.
Sir Ben Stokes. You beauty"
Make a movie on it! Wow!
17:11sec best moment in cricket history ❤️
Don't sort by newest first it is literally toxic
16:36
Ben stock lbw out but umpire did not give  out but original decision out
Suppppeeeerrrrrrrrrrrr
England won by the efforts of Ben Stokes and the two umpires
Raise up your sandpaper in respect Australians lol 😁
"I’ve watched this innings so many times but with the sky commentary team, first time with the channel 4 boys. If you haven’t heard it with the sky sports commentators I suggest you do the same and have a listen with them. Also check out the documentary on Amazon. Justin Langer kicking bins over then having to pick it all up 😂 Ahhh what a test match!"
Ben Epic inns of all time. Incredible 4th inns Hundread.
"6:33 listen closely did someone just say the word ""pakkad"" in hindi?"
DAAAYYYYYYYYUUUUUMMMMMMNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS MATCH IS AN ICONIC TEST MATCH!!
All salute to Jack Leach he did not out
Which was Better : Headingley 2019 or Gabba 2021
Best ever innings IMO.
15:23

"Dragon Arrive

🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉
"Hero Stokes, Real Hero Leach 👍"
"Best test innings of the decade, if not the century. Laxmans 281 is the best of the century and this is a close second."
13:45 Stokes reaction
"The real hero is Jack leach, he just done defence against mighty aussies"
The commentary was unbelievable
"That celebration at 17:00, This is test cricket ❤"
11.41 reminds me of six that was hit by yuvraj to Watson in t_20 world Cup
....................no words to describe.............
Best best match in the history of Test Cricket 🔥 this match is unforgettable 💖 & that winning moment & the crowd's worthy support 💖🔥 Stokes the hero of this match ✔️
When Aussie miss that run out than umpire set his mind that Australia dont want to win this match than why should I give ben Stokes Out 🤣🤣
"Pitch not good for bowlers, so benstokes can bat better, otherwise he will out for 0"
In Brisbane England have only Won 2 Test matches and Australia 27 times...But Goosebumps ..Proud of England 🤙🤙
England's crowd is one of the best crowds
"Looking at Paine I just can't stop praising MS Dhoni
U just can't take review out of ur anxiety
That might have defined the ashes
But not to take credit away from him ben stokes was according to his name 😊"
these guys are no match for india. indians are legends
Aussie Aussie Aussie?
"wow my Fvrt player ben Stocks.
Real Hero😍
i m from pakistan"
What is it with hundreds of Indians going on about themselves lol? surely there is a video of this pant for you to comment on instead of commenting on this lol...
Seriously the england team has got hell load of luck favoring them be it this match or the 2019 icc world cup
The hero of cricket-Ben Stokes
Watching England Vs India match 97/7 England😂😂😂
👍👍
9:22 The fun begins here😍🤟🔥
Goddammit there's nothing more satisfying in the sporting world than watching the hubris of Australian sport being exposed. I could watch this a thousand times and it would still be as good!
"I think the hawk eye was wrong on the LBW appeal Australia were unable to review. If you watch closely, the ball glances Stokes' front pad before hitting his back pad. Hawk eye appears to have taken the impact on the back pad as first impact. Before hitting either pad, the ball did look to be missing leg stump."
Aussies choked here
Headingley Test > World Cup Final
Still (and always will) send shivers through me! Incredible!!!
Iam from India this is the best match I never seen wow I can't describe this match wow Ben strokes he nailed it by one man this match gives emotional fight back and patriotism I love this match against Australia and I love this people's who enjoyed in the crowd as a audience they are so lucky to seen this match in live and I love cricket no border  for an international cricket love from behalf of all Indians...
"HAHAHA !!!!   people who questioned DRS  ( **dhoni""s review system**) must watch this.................."
No Stokes like others 👍👍
f for the people who think test cricket is boring
y
My favourite  cricket team is England
*One of the greatest test match of this century*
As good as Brian Lara s innings
"Ashes(Test format):- Australia vs England
Ashes(One day International and T20 format):- India vs Pakistan"
Stokes' destroyed Mumbai Indians in IPL 2020 2nd match RR vs MI
Greatest of all time
Great effort but if a player gets Soo many life lines like Stokes he'll definitely win the game. It's 70% effort 30% luck
I can watch this match 100 times Without getting bored
Delhi se hu Ben Stokes 😎😂
You know who the dislikers are:-
garbage mark nicholas
Only two person to blame 1st Nathon Lyon and 2nd the umpire
Australia had their moments but faith took over
"""I don't think of 14 ball not not out has ever meant so much"" So true."
"I personally believe kuala Perera did better than Ben ,, no luck , no home ground , no LBW chances ,"
Cricket can give u feelings which no other thing can in this world
I have ever seen a player like this what a player ben Stokes my favorite all rounder after Afridi
"13:20 Good review T Paine! Was never out, bowler knew it, costs the match."
Who is Watching in 2021 During india vs England Subscribe Here !!!!!
Slap on those who said Test Cricket is Finished
Unreal audience
This win is even bigger than world cup
One man army.💪💪💪💪💪
Benjamin Stokes 🔥
Great match
Poor umpiring
One of the best innings of all times and all formats of Cricket
In the end You were wrong 9:18 😂😂🤣🤣😇😇
Brilliant finish but it's like beating your brother at a game. Our Aussies are our kith and kin.
Accept it. This is not the last time you are watching this.
"It's bad luck for Australians , that runout chance and the plumb lbw was given not out, Paine wasted the last review although Cummins saying it's not."
anyone watching in 2021 after Indian beat Eng in 2nd test match ??
Stokes was out but not given poor umpiring
This was a magical innings.
Nathan Lyon had been beaten broadly ... He is good for nothing..
Bc ipl se bhi zyada maza aagaya
14:06 Smith looks like a baby who didn't get the toy he wanted from his parents.
This match still gives me chills. I have already watched it at least 10 times.
10:47 and 11:36 Truly cricketing intelligence!
One of the greatest innings of all time!!
ben stokes is a national hero
Peach of a knock
That drama when they need just 2 run.......was just heart stoping moment.......but stokes innings deserve that win
Ben strokes good batsmen
Bad umpiring and missed run out that's why england won..
Whenever I see that last shot all I can do is smile
And some fools are comparing this with Rishabh Pant's 89*.😀😀😀
"He won the world cup by cheating! He told in an interview that he told the umpire to cancel the extra 4 runs, but there was no such discussion or argument with the umpire."
"Love to see the smile wiped off of Warner’s face, he is the most unlikable player on either team."
🤪🤪🖕🖕🖕
This clarifies that: Never celebrate too early
Here to see how the indians have made it about themselves
New Zealand is happy to give England Christchurch born Ben Stokes.
"Lol tf AUS bottled it😂😂😂 
Ben stokes was absolutely brilliant tho🔥🔥"
"I hate cricket, but even I found my self watching this and urging him on"
13:45 Ben stokes face 🤭🤭
World cup bhi salon ne dhakke se jeeta ye ashes bhi out hogaya tha wo sala ye bhi dhakke se jeeta
chutiya umpire. lbw tha
Wasn't the second last ball clearly LBW? This was not a fair win.
"Greatest ""1"" of all time. Hard to believe the aura of Test Cricket. Respect for England and Australia they celebrate this game"
I notice one thing....... Nathan lyon falling to back side same as he falling in gabbba...... M I right....?
Kohli: that's my boi right there!
🤪🤪🖕🖕🖕🖕
Australia must win match 2 catches dropped this is poor performance
One of the best batting innings ever.  Ben Stokes wasn't bad either.
The highlight is that umpire 🤣🤣🤣
"Australia lost twice in this match, one when Paine went for a desperate review and second being Nathan's pressure runout miss."
"Australia bowler: ben stokes 😂😂
Samajh rahe ho!! 😅🤣"
"Best example of ""Fortune favours the brave"".
Ben you beauty."
best test match ever
I want to watch this type of innings from indians at stadium is really good
Sometimes winner isn't winner.
One of the best n best 👍🏻 many times watched this.... 🔥🔥🔥
So you’ll regret iy
Australia is better
Not fair
Grrrr
Actually Ben stokes is out worst decision by Joel Wilson
"Everyone talking about pant vs stokes the two left handers who demolished Australia 
But deep down we all know the real demolishes was Lara’s 153* in 98-99"
Still brings me tears of joy every time I watch it Ben stokes is the only living legend
He is the best all-rounder I've seen😎👍
"Even as an Aussie I was hoping this gun bat would do it, in my opinion the greatest innings ever played, how bout that atmosphere and the commentating jeez"
Watching it in 2021 but This match is still giving me goosebumps 🔥☄️
How is butler out here? Lyon hits the wickets with his hands 😶
One man army
I don’t think even English people would have this video as much as Indians watch.
Whenever I'm feeling down I come back to this video. Never fails to give goosebumps and a massive smile on my face.
That review played a major role...
Anyone Wanting in 2021 ..... 🏏
I wish England play wit Pakistan in Pakistan  3 test 5 odi a 3 t20
bad lock ausis
Greatest ashes performance of all time by Stokes.
"Great match as this is, Umpires need to go, they're the most useless things on the planet, just use technology to decide everything, reviews and umpires and all that trash are worthless"
🖒✌👏👍👌💪
"Keep watching it again and again, and it keeps getting better and better.."
player of the match : jack leach
England clinging on luck. But maybe the pioneers getting luck from GOD to motivate cricket
Real winner no doubt australia. That lbw.
"When I was a little boy growing up in Yorkshire, I’d sometimes imagine what the greatest cricketing triumph would be like.  I’d imagine I could magically do everything, bowl, field and bat like some sort of cricketing superman.  When would it be best to do that?  In a Headingley Ashes test match of course.  Even when I dreamt I could do anything, I don’t think I ever dreamed that anyone could do what Ben Stokes did in this match.
There was also that little matter of the world cup as well.  What a player."
Man of the match :umpire
"It's a combination of T20, One day and a test match ❣️❣️🔥🔥"
"literally i watch this every week 
this give me goosebumps"
Paine is a dum ass Captain. Period
He's unbelievable. Awesome..!!!!
AUS had chances but they missed
"And now india also destroyed by stokes and root, 😂😂"
Can we all take a moment to appreciate the commentary in this game. It often goes un- noticed. Absolutely Brilliant.
"Kusal Perera (SL)153* v South Africa 2019      (SL won by 1 wkt)
Ben Stokes (Eng) 135* v Australia 2019           (Eng won by 1 wkt)
Rishabh Pant (India) 89* v Australia 2021      (India won by 3 wkts)
Kyle Mayers (WI) 210* v Bangladesh 2021     (WI won by 3 wkts)

All great 4th innings match winning knocks from impossible situations!!! Test cricket is alive!!

Whats your favourite?"
England should have lost this. Wrong decisions.
Second only to Kusal Perera's 153
🦵🦵🤪🤪🖕🖕🖕
🤪🤪🖕🖕🖕
He is the most dangerous batsman I have ever seen .
Even indain are watching ashes
If cricket was fair! Why there are incorrect decisions by the umpires why ? Why ICC does not removes it ?
Mark Nicholas's commentary is on another level 👌🔥.
That 1 run.. Lol🤣🤣..
Most sensational inning
What a worst review by Tim Paine at that movement...🙏🙏..
"Both had there chances. Ben Stokes was incredible.
The review lost was game changing moment. If AUS had a review left they would have won

Moral of the story : Don't have idiots like Tim Paine as Captain"
Stokes face at 14:06 sums it all up really.
"Fun fact: The match is played between England and Australia

Le comment section : Indians**"
"In india this kind of player are known as
Paglate
Thas"
"Honestly these Britishers didn't deserve to win the Final of WC2019 and even this ashes match ! They were just simply ""lucky"" with decisions going in their favour."
Watched this match highlight more than 100 times.. But every time it seems so intresting... Love u storks
Now to Gabba highlights
Who is here after England ne India kao India mei pellaa
"Not sure about India or pants. 

But this is the single greatest ashes innings of all time."
"And that's how the man, the myth, the legend, The great Jack leach rose to prominence
..... Salute to you champ......Your sacrifice will never be forgotten"
All I can Say is Pant is overrated 🙄
What an amazing match!!
05:20 Was Buttler run out ?
Had this test been won by India with the hero as Hardik Pandya instead of Stokes Sir then the Indian media would have gone berserk and played this video on their respective channels for months on loop! Glad it was England who knows how to control themselves. Much love!
"Last thing you want while defending on last day is a left hander joined by tail ender hitting you all over the park 
Ft - Ben stokes and Rishab Pant"
Lyon saved Leech's career 13:57
@ 15:00 - the greatest 1 in test match history!
"Man of the match: Umpire Wilson
Australia won by 2 runs."
Ben  .
14:50 that reaction shows how much thrilling this match was
Manjrekar pls watch this to understand how to do commentary during a great test match
I m feeling like if India win against England in the upcoming series..Ashes will be played just to directly play with Team Ind
Test cricket was the winner on the day
"No hitchcock movie can match the thriller. And the pre-climax scenes were excellent, nail bitting. One wrong review from Paine costed this match for him."
I have 100 times watched this highlight 😊😊👏👏👏
Lengend knows Ben stokes is great great all rounder of ashes and world cup
"Best thing about Ashes is High Quality commentary. ""Has he dropped the Ashes""???"
"13:55 that moment when you need one marks to pass the exam,  you write the correct answer but with wrong spelling.. 😂"
The crowd was lit🔥
"Won by cheating
Just like in worldcup final"
still lost the Ashes :)
At 4Am watching this insane
Nice match!!
I support kapil mishra
I can watch this 1000 times
0:11 injurian aussies after ind Series. Remember?
"2019 stokes year, 2020 corona year,2021 ......"
Love the way the Aussies line up to congratulate Stokesy. That's cricket!
Greatest innings ever
"*Some great knocks*
*[1]* _Lara's _*_153*_*_ vs Australia_
*[2]* _Laxman's _*_281_*_ vs Australia_
*[3]* _Parera's _*_153*_*_ vs South Africa_
*[4]* _Stokes _*_135*_*_ vs Australia_
*[5]* _Pant's _*_89*_*_ vs Australia_

*Why maximum knocks are against Australia*"
He was out at the time when they needed just 2 runs to win. So...
"Can't be a better cricket match ever, yes that's test cricket for you"
Greatest test match of the 21st century
Left hand batsmen destroying Australia’S pride 😁
watching again and again.. It tears me. What a incredible performance by Stokes///
13:25 how important that reviews was???
Nathon Lyon🙄
BUT HEY ............AUSTRALIA ACTUALLY WON THAT MATCH BECAUSE NATHAN LYON GOT HIM OUT BUT IT WAS UMPIRE'S HOWLER
Ban stocks
Fixed match
"Kusal Perera, Ben Stokes and Rishabh Pant, all 4th innings chase heroes and left-handed batsmen. So one can actually say lefties are the X-factors in the side. 😎


Edit: Kusal Perera's 153* against South Africa in South Africa is one of the best and most underrated innings ever."
One as to agree that it’s overwhelming joy only you beat the best in the business. Australia goes down every now and then still manages to be the no1 cricket team in the world :
Even Umpires and Fielderd supported Ben stokes
Virat be like What Innings Ben stokes
"Ben stokes is different then pant ben stokes can play with tale ender but rishab pant can,t"
After pant innings 😍

"Paine goes for an unwanted review
Lyon missed a run out chance 
Lyon almost redeems for the mistake bowls a beauty get a clear lbw  but decision goes against Lyon and no review left
Most famous 1 run by tailenders for England
And then year of Ben Stoke"
Every thing went under England's way as usual as world Cup Finals
How do they pick the commentary for the highlights? Was the sky folks the first 3 days and this is BT? Or channel 4?
One of the best match I have ever witnessed brilliant Stokes 🙌
All Australians after seeing this- Benstokes!
"Hahaha and normal public thinks thats thriller match, but only dawood knows that lucrative match 👍"
"One of his best test innings.





Take a bow Jack Leach."

Such as stupid review taken  coz hole  test match blady phool captain
"Once a legend said : ""come to Gabba"" and rest is history

Tq for 1k likes!!"
Lyon and umpires choked
2019 was Stokes' year
Australia win this match easily but Australia not review left Ben stokes out for lbw
Both teams fought till there last breath but I gotta say that stokes innings was exceptional.
Danger man stokes
"This match gives me goosebumps  every time I watch. 
Never seen anything even near to this .
Ben stokes you played a innings that no one will ever be able to repeat truly sensational 🥇🏅🏆"
This is the best ever test match I have seen
Ben Stokes innings was better than virat whole career
Two of our heros gill and pant
This loss is nothing for Australia as compared to what happened at gabba against India B team 😝😝😝
"🤣🤣🤣 
Most Lucky team ENGLAND
CWC 2019"
0:37 what a catch
"England didn’t win, Australia gifts this Match to them.Tim (pain in the Ass)"
Nowadays Test crickets are more thrilling than limited overs ...
"2 min silence for those who is comparing this legend to pant 

Sorry to say 
If pant is king 
stokes is god"
Lucky Ben
Final day dekhna hai to India ka match dekho
Because he win umpires mistake
One thing is common in this match and india vs Aus. Gabba test that lyone fall on ground and on same position...
Nothing from England all about Aussies' mistakes.
"Basically England got 3 chances 1 drop catch, 1 runout miss chance, and the bribed umpire who was the biggest ass hole, should have a case on it, Is he biased or blind can't tell that, should ask him."
Australia deserved the win.. That LBW decision of not out fucked up things.. For me Australia won this match 👀
"Its about stokes luck 
The best test inning ever is kjp153*"
This match i remember  stupidity of aus caption  and nathan leon
I can watch this match millions of times. That's why test is best.♥️♥️
14:01 Lmao...I can't stop laughing
13:21 Lol
No matter which country you are from you will love ben stokes for this inning
I love Englishmen cricket  .. Ben done great job ......
That’s the greatest 1 run taken in history ! :D
"What a SHOT,What a CELEBRATION!!!!🔥15:18"
History of test cricket ( Headingley ) ' ODIs (WC Final) and T-20 (Eng vs WI final) is incomplete without Ben Stokes ☺
Wt a match... Wt a confident...
Best test innings after kusal perera ❤️
13:58
"Something is fishy here
1) Paine review was illogical
2) mango runout miss
3)dead clean LBW given N.O"
"""the greatest 1 of all time""! such talent, skill, thinking and such drama - impossible in a shorter format"
Never mess with a man who doesn't anything to loose... Ben Stokes is that man✋😍😍😍😍 wooaaaaahhhhhh what a innings✋ the lion Ben Stokes 😍🥰
"Please 1 like for Leech as well, the way he survived was so brave♥️"
Reached to his 100 still not celebrated because victory was important♥️
If stokes and pant join same team in IPL then everybody can predict champions of IPL.🔥😍🥰
Happy to see England and India let the Aussie cry.
Disliking for BAD UMPIRING 😡😡😡🤬
This match went to England because of the wrong decision of umpire to not have adjusted Ben Stokes as LBW off Nathan Lyon.
"Stokes headingley 2019
Pant Gabba 2021"
Who are Australian fans like here
Gem of England cricket
Stocks on peak of its career
Stokes innings of his life
Poor decisions by Australia made England win this match
Ben stokes 💪💪💪💪
Lyon dropped and Ball and the ashes as well!!
Certainly one of the cricket's remarkable innings ever. Simply great batting.
Superb wining phad Diya Australia ko❤️❤️❤️
Greatest 1 of all time 🔥
Hit like if u hv watched this more then one time
"Always umpires favor England the cheater.
Stokes is a plumb LBW as same as in CWC 2019"
3rd class umpiring
Goosebumps Cricket
Fortune as always goes for the beavers
Aussies are not good with reviews! Cost them the match.
Lyon...Poor guy
"Mark nicholes you beauty

Love your commentary

Love and lot of respect from india"
Watching so many times😍❤
U are legend
What a player stoky
The most dramatic test match ever !!!!
Poor captiancy by tim paine using the review for fun under pressure
"Every person in the country?
What are you talking about?
He has inspired Everyone who has seen this across the world!"
Superman 😍
"What a great test match.
The gentleman's cricket"
Now it is Rishabh Pant after Ben stokes for Aussies!
https://youtu.be/7F-f7rBTnzQ
Feeling sad those who missed this match and never watched the highlights! 😌
Don't miss this if you are here 17:04
Greatest single of all time  15:04
14:35 how could on Earth it went not out ? That's plumb.
"As moments of game: 
*Eng need 8 runs with last wicket*
Josh to leach : AUS reviewed ..and lost the last review
      Six!
*Eng need 2 run to win*
Nathan Lyon to stokes :   very simple run out miss
*Eng need 2 run to win*
Lyon to stokes :  lbw...  But umpire give not out , AUS have no review
*After that England makes 2 run*"
Benjamin Andrew Stokes ❤️
One of the best matches ever
Leach took a most important single run in England cricket history!!!🙃
Best test match for me🔥🔥🔥
If they saved the review....may be they won
Then stokes now pant
Joel Wilson should have given that out. Anyway england are going to review but aus does not have a review. Stokes was out and the game would have been over with aus winning by a mere 1 run. We never had that 1 run victory in tests I believe. And Lyon choked under the pressure. It's a regulation run-out.
"Very bad captaincy by pain...Cowerd captain of all time Australian captains...
WHY leyon in last time????
Why used DRS ??"
"Yeah, I see 4k aussies here 😂😂"
Ben fucking Stokes ...Wt a batting
Umpire ?
pain waste
England was plain lucky....
God knows when we'll going to witness such a crowd in cricket again🥺
"Aussies committed lot of mistakes
1. Bowling changes
2. Missed run out
3. Took DRS when ball was clearly outside leg, that saved ben stokes and they won."
"Which one is best
Rishabh pant  or 
Ben stokes ......"
BEST
I used to hear single handedly ....but today i came to knw to what its really means....
OUTSTANDING FAVOULUS LEGEND BEN STOKES HIT AND WIN FOR ENGLAND
Man of the match umpire
Worst umpiring at the crucial stage
"Waiting for the India-England series to see who among Stokes, Jadeja and Pant performs better. These three Lefties make the mighty Australia looks like a Leftover Team."
Ben stokes u beauty 🙌
All the faults go to Tim Paine. He should not take that review before the final over of the game. Such a disgrace.
"5:06 Butler was always going outside the crease  in almost every match ,when ashwin mankaded him, people were criticizing ashwin for that but now it has almost costed the ashes for England"
"I watched it live from 200 odd runs in the chase and I must say that, this is by far...I mean really really far, the most entertaining match in the cricketing history. There were so many chances for Oz and silly mistakes by capitan(wasting the review in the end) and warrior attitude of Stokes has finally paid off in the end. TEST CRICKET IS STILL THE BEST CRICKET🏏"
Australia would have won the match had the Umpire gave right decision of giving out to Ben stokes for LBW
Legends says historic finishes are finished with a boundary🔥
This looks some sort of fixing who thinks the same ??😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
Ben stokes king of allrounder
Jack Leach the man again.
This better than the Gabba this is the better than the Indians.
Win in aus against aus with a B team anyday beats this win by poms at home
Stokes is my favorite Player
"Aussie chokers! Gabbatoir was bigger, away from home, more challenging pitch, a much larger ground and a team on its last wheels!"
Virat kohli after watching the inning: Wah BEN STOKES
"2:08 that reaction
When gf says baby nobody is at home😂😂🤘🏻"
I would rate this one is the toughest and one of the best in test and then gabba just coz of stokes one man army from 2nd down to batting till end and when 84 required with 1 wicket in hand batting most of balls and scoring runs and then winning is something extra ordinary and then of course Gabba no doubt coz of the way india fought back from 36 all out to players getting injured and then playing with new comers and winning the trophy . Great matches ..
the most entertaining test cricket match ever....that run out miss by lyon and hopeless review miss by paine was hilarious....luck plus dedication of stokes...
Gabba ma ghabha kadhi nakhya ..
Never gonna forget this innings
Match fixedd
Joel wilson win the match 😂
Tht was Devine...
Legend
Here real winner is Australia 😂😂😂nd man of the is umpire
Gabba fortress they said...lol😂😂😂
"2016 year of england bad luck
2019 year of england very very good luck"
"Spiderman, spiderman, tune churaya mere dil ka chain😂"
Whenever I watch ben stocks I miss yuvraj singh he bet like him....
This match shows the greatness of test matches
Crowd 😱
That waste drs review against leach costed aussie the game
"1.what a knock that was from ben SPECTACULAR ..innings to history books
2.and hats off to that blind guy who wore glasses and standing at the stumps.. 
3.Last but not the least no words to describe that from paine a review on pitching outside off delivery."
"I remember, i switched on to casually see this cz I knew England won't win, but well xD"
Who is watching in 2021???
Well the LBW was OUT. But then it was Paine's stupidity to take review for that clearly pitching outside leg stump off starc. And moreover Ben stoke definitely deserved that win. It was an unbelievable innings where he managed the last wicket partnership like a genius protecting leech.
"16:21 lyon hugs stokes, anybody think like that"
Anybody see 100 by lyon 09:52 Subscribe & like me
05:28 is it out!!!!!! Check once again 05:15
"Marcus Harris dropped catch of Ben Stokes where , there was chance to win for Australia , but it didn't.

Australia's worst review which was mentioned as Not Out.

Umpire has cheated which was to be given as Out.

The Run Out which was missed by Nathan Lyon to win this test match.

( This drama was not to be done. )"
5:24 🤔 is it really RUNOUT
"Amazing co - incidence : Stokes was wearing a 55 no. Jersey and this was his 55th test match...


And we know what miracle he did 😁😁"
"One wrong decision hurt to much 
Run out chance mised after that umpire given wrong decision"
Lyon how bad luck..Run. Out then umpire not given out...Clear that was out
Still 70 runs to get with only one wicket in hand what an brilliant innings from stokes...🔥Hats off ben❤️ Don't forget he is also responsible for winning the world cup 2019 too... Unbelievable hittings and cricketing skills😍 Welcome to INDIA ben...Can't wait to see the rivalry bt India and England
Nathan Lyon must hate left handers
Empire meharbaan to stokes pehalwan ☺
One of the best teast match of my life....
one of best test match. amazing player Ben 👏
Classic  innings by stokes
This vl always remain my eva fav test match last innings
After winning Ben stoke said Ben stokes
WTF are australians doing here? They had 2 chances to win by 1run!!!! Lmao
Now they have no Pride 😆😆😆
ഓസ്‌ട്രേലിയ കോട്ട ഗാബ ഇന്ത്യ തകർത്തിട്ട് വന്ന മലയാളികൾ ആരെങ്കിലും ഉണ്ടോ ?
that 1 from leach  made the difference
"Jack leach's one run ""the greatest one run of all time"" 🙌🙌🙌"
There was a time when this was the greatest win of this century...
Still aussies are most favorites except the too much of sledging.
"Epic chase from English team..
You should watch from 9:20"
Rong umpiring Australia fevrote this is match umpiring side England
"Was Gabba more epic than headingley? India demolish the fortress of Gabba which was invincible for 39 years.... Against all odds... After 36  All out in first test. Not being the favourites for the series. Playing with their A team. Only two people in the playing 11 who had played 4 tests in the series. 2 debutants, Most experienced pacer in the bowling attack has the experience of two matches?....
What are your views on Indian breach on the unsinkable titanic @ Gabba"
Wrost match
Wow... who is watching jan 2021
Importance of 1 review
Looks like fixed😟
"Everyone blaming lyon for missing the runout .
Meanwhile cummins: thank God no one noticed I wasted our last review which could have been used to overturn stokes lbw appeal 🤪😁"
"England Won
Meanwhile Australia : Ben stokes 
😂😂"
Nathan liyon is villain
It's time for pant stunner in gabba
"Cricket at It's absolute best, That's why Test is the real  gem of that Game, i saw the game live but want to see Again & Again. Hero’s are not born they Are made. Lucky to witness Two best ever Cricket match, this one & at Gabba ind vs Aus 2020-21 season. Two memorable cricket match 😊"
Indians ruined this video comment section...
Stoke was out
"Aus deserve in losing side as that run out chance was the easiest one ever which is missed and it was not rocket throw that he missed with his hands ,that lbw was the most luckiest decision gone on Eng side and that Harris catch was to grab at this level but they didn't handle pressure"
"But the greatest test series is yet to come ,whatta series Ind vs aus BG trophy greatest ever come back stories"
"that last review off Cummins has to be the dumbest review ever taken, cost them the ashes."
17:10 Lyon Falling- did the exact same thing when Rishabh hit the winning runs in Gabba #AusVsInd
Downfalls has started for australian cricket...
A very special innings by stokes.. but how can that not be given out. Unbelievable.
❤️
Pita hmesha Australia. Hi hain chahe india se ho ya England se
"Jack leach run of century 
Think if he didn't scored a single run match could have been Tied and England's heart could have been broken  lol 😂😂 jack leach is unsung hero
No doubt Stokes is the Hero of Headingley .....but jack leach also has equal contribution in that match"
"I wonder if this wasn’t the atmosphere or the scenario  , umpire might have not felt that much pressure and probably gave Ben Stokes out on Lyon’s ball which was absolutely plumb to naked eyes. 
P.S This was Ben Stokes best and once in a life time knock"
Just wow
"All kudos to stokes however england shouldn't have won this. Pathetic run out miss but what about that lbw? Before you come after me, i live in India:)"
That's how luck works😂 always an X factor in Cricket 🏏
MOM  : Joe wilson
Lyon drop the ashes
Ben Stokes and Rishab panth both left handers destroyed bully Aussies😂🔥💯
Kohli after watching this Ending- Benstoke
"Tim Paine waste the review
That cost Australia the match
Wel done Tim 😁😁🤣🤣🤣"
Just imagine umpire gave that Ben stock LBW. game over.
He is great 👍
Had they not taken that review against leach in the previous over
Ben stocks just tell the cricket lovers that there is nothing is impossible in cricket 🏏 man I I am a huge fan of him just love this man 😍
Aussies robbed lyon lbw shout was plum how can the umpire not see that when poms needed 2 for victory
17:00 greatest cricket moment of all time...
Mark Nicholas is the best commentator
Australia should have won it if umpire gave the right lbw decision
Aussies won the match!!
"6:33 
Pakad!"
I am here to see 'who is here after' comments 🤣🤣🤣
"Think if the number of balls played by batsmen is not shown in the brief scorecard when Pujara is batting, people would think he have just come out to bat even if he plays more than 3 hours 😂😂😂"
"Ben stokes just turned a test match into T20 cricket

One of the best  test match i've ever witnessed after 2005 lord's test match"
"Sorry folks! England did not win this... Australia lost it!!
Makes me believe Gabba win is finer"
Wow this.is.awesome!
"All left handers have butchered Aussies
1. Brian lara 158*
2. Benstokes in this match
3. Rishabh pant 70 odd runs in 2021 final test"
9:49 what a shot!!!
"I think this match should go in favour of  Australia because stoke dropped, one time run out chance, and one time lbw but no review remained😌"
"Umpire was fool....had he given out n if it was wrong then still England had a review but Australia no....ICC Umpiring has gone so low, which was also seen in latest Australia vs India test series m what's use  of fake win."
Come to Gabba type match 😂😂😂
Who is coming after bauaa's video 😂
Agony
India' s win Australya is much Greater than this because England played in their own condition Ben stocks would be played for Newzeland
The Big Ben .....
"Best test cricket match I have ever ever watched, I am so Lucky I have witnessed it live ❤️"
Tim Paine is most unlucky Captain of Aussie.& This English Team is luckiest Team ever.
My favourite moment of the whole Test was Lyon missing the run out.
"Moral : Don't waste DRS, take suggestions from father of DRS, MS Dhoni"
"Wow, just wow.
Ben stokes,you beauty.❤️✊🔥"
Poor decision on Review by Capt Paine finally ended up with nothing...
"Stokes: I am a left hand batter. That's how I destroyed Aussies.

Pant: Allow me Stokey.
Edit:
Meanwhile 
W Sundar: Did someone said about left hand batter.. !!!"
The best thing about this match is the sound of the English people supporting every single ball!
"Ben stokes is a treat to watch 🔥🔥
Going to be an all time great all rounder?
Also that review by tim paine was one of the worst reviews taken in the history of cricket 😅 he could've used that for that lyon's delivery..."
India's Gabba victory is much more bigger than this one.
Why went wrong decision went with the favour to English side. Even the World Cup.
"""I think pain have no mind he just waste review and their for they lost a whole match """
Game is on baby🔥
"Lion ka run out na karna
Aus ka galat drs lena
Umpire ka out na dena


3 time back to back bad luck for ausi"
Kya khela hai Bennn Stocckks
No one talk about jofra archer
17:08 the greatest moment
"Stokes and rishab ,these both name australia will never forget 😊😉"
Gabba mein danda diye 😍
Commentary adds a lot of color to cricket...I mean Sri Lanka also pulled off a stunner like this but poor or okayish commentary didn’t give it that importance
"Jack leach you are my hero😂
Watched uncountable times."
The crowd in this game is so alive.. test cricket and the crowd in England.. the legend of test cricket lives on and on.. games like these. The Sydney test of 2021.the Brisbane test.. we are privileged to watch some excellent commitment
"Now every one tell me ....
Who are CHOKERS on final day ??"
India’s win against Australia is similar to this win.
Leach was the hero
Was anyone in the comment thread there at Headingley? Looks like an  amazing atmosphere. Simply brilliant. Gday from Oz!
Same between stokes and pant and result also same 😝😝👍
That day... stokes should've bought  a lottery ticket.
"16:59 that slo-mo with final shot and crowd rising in the background, is probably the best ever of cricket history."
Paine take review early for not going unuse but later they need them. If they had review they would definitely win the match
"All of sudden the views on this video raises up ..
Reason : India breached Aussies in Gabba."
👍👍👍
"Conclusion do not take review unnecessary, paine are in huge mistske"
This is one of the greatest test innings ever in cricket history.
"Unnecessary review by Tim Paine, otherwise they would have taken review at end."
Ben stokesss
2 test matches Australia will never forget... One being this one and other one at Gabba vs India.
14:33 That was close!!!
Ben stokes did not raise his bat after reaching his 50 & 100. He only celebrated when England won🔥❤️😘
17:7 watch that and you r getting goosebumps
"BEN STOKES:- U did the same thing with Australia what your name says!!
What an innings ❤️. I have watched it a number of times bt that inning is smthng different
Love from India❤️"
Mark Nicholas commentary and Ben Stokes batting ❤️
"Well played stokes, but pant and gill played very well last day they scored 320 runs🇮🇳🇮🇳"
"We need to improve our commentary here in india !!! They make matches boring , good match +great commentary = great match , great match + avg commentary = good match 

We have had a lot of great nail baiting games but the commentary made them not so great !!!"
Leach is the hero
Who is here after Joe Biden's inaguration?
Its karma for aussies then headingley now gabba 💥
Who is here IN 2021
Australians will never forget headingley and gabba 😂😂
2 unpredictable left handers have murdered Australian cricket team. One is stokes and another is pant
Australian welcome to Gaba 😂
This match is a slap on those people who say hardik Pandya is the best all rounder .😂😂
"I am also indian fan guys and very happy that india beat aus at gabba.
But pls don't compare this match to gabba test.
Headinley test level was out of this world.🙏
This kind of cricket happens once in a century and we witnessed it 2 times in wc final and headingley and both the time the man was Ben stokes."
Australian will always remember innings of Ben Stokes and Rishabh Pant
Sab Indian commenters 😂😂😂😂😂
The test
Whenever you were in out of form just come and watch this 🔥
"Dream home
#Dwarkahomes"
"That was such a bad decision given by the umpire, Joe Wilson. I know Paine's review against Leach, where the ball was clearly falling outside leg, was an awful decision and did cost Australia the match. But umpires knew that Australia didn't have any review left and England still had one left. It was a very close lbw call against Stokes and the umpire should have ruled in the favour of the Australians. Even if he was wrong in giving Stokes out, England would certainly have used the DRS and the right decision would have been made in the end. But can't take anything away from Stoke's masterful batting. He played the part of the lone wolf to almost perfection and took England home in a great fashion."
"Stokes is awesome, but there's always a part that the umpire plays in his heroics."
"This tells the umpires are also too much pressurized while the game is on, only the umpires irrespective of both countries should be allowed . Aussies deserved the win . And paine is such a useless captain .also lyon what a jerk you are are man 😑"
"All the Indians in comments - 
Who's here after gabba win ,so silly"
2:02 daymm he didn't give up.
That Review! Paine is Manav from Dhamaal. Aisi situation me main automatically aage kaise ho jaata hu?! 🤓
That's why u always need someone like dhoni in ur team to take correct DRS based on calculations and not through emotions
U see how India beat Aussies at Gabba. Hit like if u enjoy that serries
"Headingley 2019 or Edgbaston 2005 which one was more entertaining, thrilling?"
Best test innings i have seen ever🔥
Fallen Kingdom of Australian Cricket

"Aus would have won the ashes had paine not taken the review against leach. Stokes was out, and even run out was missed"
Find me a better love story than Tim Paine and bad reviews.
It's fucking fixed match simple run out opportunity missed by Lyon and lbw not given by the umpire
"India's Gabba win has taken over this🔥
So proud as Indian❤️"
One of the greatest innings of 4th innings .
"I  appreciate the efforts of strokes but, I think this match was all about clickbait."
"13:57
Cricket sensation at peak"
I love this type of crowd in test cricket. In this case English are the best👍💯
"""Ben Stokes""😁"
Bauaa ka welcome Benstokes k bad कौन कौन आये हैं
bt y thy go fr review in case of outside leg thy knw by which thy not get chance in nathons over which is out😬
left handed batsmen are not good for aus speacially on last day😂🤣
"Two left-handers that Lyon won't forget, Stokes & Pant."
I wish the same audience response for India's win at Gabba stadium... What a match !
"Pant( India ) : like👍👍👍
Stokes( England) : 👎👎👎
Comments 👇 👇👇👇👇"
Tim paine should not be trusted with drs. It was clearly not a lbw. Australia should have kept their review
Who is here after RJ Raunac No-Po ben stokes video
This by far the best test match ever...
Real butchering started when Strokes came to batting... .. loved  it and Leach was too good for Aussie.
England se hu Ben_stokes..😎
Joe Wilson Man of the Match
Was this a 4 day test match
2019 was the year of Ben stokes.Hero of World Cup and Ashes.
That audience 🤩🤩🤩❤
Absolute Crazy Crowd
Ben Stocks Khel gye :)
Tim Paine to hai  hi chutiya
14:00 nathon lyon class😂😂😂
Tim paine shows his worst captaincy
best match...
Its more like the Aussies lost it more than the English won it
This and now India winning at the gabba I think  Australians are gonna be really worried in the future when there's a middle order left hand batsmen still on the crease on the last day haha 😂
First headingley then gabba two nails in Aussie's test championship final coffin
the worst decision in this match was take by Tim Paine when he reviewed the lbw during the cummins over. Had they left with that review they would have wo the match.
Greatest test match ever ! 👏👏👏
This is real test match
Ben Stokes op😂😂
First time I sawamy drop of chances by Australia anyway 🤩stokes 🙌
THIS IS INCREDIBLY DONE BYE BEN STOKES
Wah Ben Stoke😂
We r waiting for you #Stokes ....👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
You beauty stokes
Nothing beats the gabba heroics 😄
"Omg! This is savage! Hitting 90 runs in d last wicket...crazzyyy!! I thought Ind vs aus Gabba test was d best ever..but I don't think anything can beat this!😱😱 AUS had so many chances towards d end, yet they couldn't take even 1 wicket! Incredible!! Ben stokes is a magician! Lucky fans to witness this spectacle!"
"Literally Nobody :
Hazlewood: Breaks Headguards only....."
rishab pant  and ben stokes   😄
"From Aus need 1 wkt to win to
           Eng win by 1 wkt"
"Ben stokes ❤❤ well played...
          Pant and gill ❤❤❤🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
....
Now it's India vs England 🔥🔥"
14:02 who notices nathan Lyon and umpire were sitting in the same position🤣🤣🤣
one of the best cricket matches of all time. the crowd makes it even more beautiful

Cummins/paine/Lyon lost the Ashe's for Aussies in dramatic last hour🙄
Left handers are Butchering Aussies🤔 Stokes then Pant now❤
Best run Chase ever
"Sad for Aussie ,, those last two chances......... 
Happy for England
East and west INDIA is the best"
"I thought Cricket was a team sport but after watching Ben Strokes in the world cup and this test match, I am realizing that ""one-man army""/Rambo can exist in Cricket! :)"
Match was fixed...that's a fact
Fix
It's nothing in front of ind vs aus gabba test.
Hats off to ben stokes and more over for leech who stood with ben for the last wicket.. best last day of test match ever
Ben stokes is amazing for this ashes
Pat Cummins is the worst bowler against the left handed batsman...
Again umpires favoured Englandlike in worldcup. Its really unfair the Umpire gives wrong decision in last moments even when technology is available.
Watching this after half way through the 2nd test of the Sri Lanka series Jan 2021 and this brings back unbelievable memories. Ben stokes is included with Englands Elite all rounders along with Botham and Flintoff but after watching this again and seeing how good this was I'm saying he's Englands best.
This was definitely Ben Stokes day. A lot of luck but well played.
Most of them watched this match after Gabba!!
"That picture when stokes hits his last stop and celebrates, and then a second later the crowd behind him goes into chaos. Great picture. Spine tingling.
Going to have to view the pride of Gabba by the looks of it now!"
I still get goosebumps
Australia lost due to wrong decision from umpire and missed run out from lyon
A Leach at number 11? Well...🤷
"Be it WC19 Final or Headingley, Umpires seem to favour Ben Stokes."
India king
First eng and then India yar these teams r unreal
m.o.m in both the matches(india and eng) ...tim payne
I'm here after india vs australia Gabba are you ??? Hit like if you are tooo
Champion's never celebrate on their personal feat!
"Mathew wade taken catch wokes and mayank in the way and same style . 
More importantly result are also same 😂😂"
Now add India in that record chase ... Who is here after that quality chase at gaba ??
"One off the Best batting ever,watched this live, greatest"
Joe Wilson n Lyon are responsible  for Australia's defeat
Stokes Was lucky That Umpire Didn't Give Him Out N That Run-out tooooo 😂
India♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Same out wokes and mayank
"Stop Reading 
First tell me Who is here?"
"Which one was a better match 
This one or Ind Vs Aus Gabba"
Poor Umpiring
Kinda feel for the Australians in this. That was an LBW when England needed 2 runs. Also that run out blunder
"17:08 gives me fucking goosebumps. i was watching it live, and wow, it was ecstasy on par with winning the world cup. it was a fucking journey that match"
Who is here after India beat Australia at the Gabba😍
"Match: England vs Australia (ashes 2019)
Comments: India vs Australia (Bgt 2020)"
“What the worst review Tim Paine has taken shame on him!”
When your morale is down.... watch this
Who is here after India's historic win at gabba? 😍
17:11...best picture EVER!
Can’t wait to see you at Gabba 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
unwanted review in cummins over and easy runout missed by lyon
I'm an indian and apart from indian matches in very few matches I got goosebumps and literally this is best match where india isnt playing...everytime I got goosebumps
Ben stokes is the greatest allrounder I have seen. Does well in crunch situations
"How it started - Ben Stokes 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
How it's going - Rishab Pant 🇮🇳"
"Tim Paine does not take good decisions during a pressure situation, review taken eventhough it was outside leg is a crime ....as a wicketkeeper he shld have known it!!! The review wasted was the only review left in this innings and they cldnt take one when Lyon had Stokes plumb in between LBW....Paine takes some irrational decisions and that is madness ...Australia are known for their hard fought victories , but under Paine they are just crumbling and need to get their act together to survive ...forget winning !!"
Stokes is my hero
Indians commenting about their win in a completely unrelated video. What a joke.
Wow. Missing that audience in gabba😍😍
Stokes you rock.
All courtesy to the Australian fielding and the bad call of umpire on Stokes LBW...and yes Ben's strong batting
Leach is also a warrior
Comment section me bhi indian hi bhare h😁😁😁
"We all know Aus won that match 
It was  umpires fault
But one of the best innings in test cricket history and the best in the ashes..........❣️"
Paine- Can't wait to see you at Gabba
"The main difference between Gabba and Headingley test is that,  "" England was playing at their home,  
But.....  But.....  India was playing away from home  !!! 
So Gabba win is far far ahead of this  !!🙏🙏🙏👌👌👌👌"
"By watching Gabba test match,  I realized that Gabba test match win was way way better than this !!"
"Best single of century 😎, after dravids 46 balls single 😜"
"Only if tim paine had not taken the review earlier, they would have reviewed stokes lbw and won by 1 run"
Who watching after the gabba india vs aus test
"N indians praising Hanuma Vihari 
Lol
This z calld performance 
Take a bow"
2021 gabba. rishbh pant. in australia 2-1 india series win. itu than mass
"Looking at the fielding chances missed, seems like a fixed one. Those chances were easy ones...."
"Team: defeats Australia.
Lyon: *Im'ma squat and back roll myself....*"
Ben stokes literally Stocked Australia's Ben...Only indians can understand- with  love frm Kohli...😉😉😉😉
Lucky stokes
Nothing better then india india is no.1 team at this time England your most welcome in india 👍🏻😁 we are waiting 😂
https://youtu.be/hRYT7DwPaio
Stokes played one of the greatest innings in his career❤
"When the destiny conspires, everything falls out of place."
I m here after india wins the GABBA FORTRESS and wins series 2-1
I’m watching this match like 19th time favorite of Ben stokes waiting for ind vs eng this time I’m looking for pant / Gill to run the game but Ben is classic 👏👍👌👍
Now pant 😀
Jos butler not out
This is insane. You could clearly see Aussies were destined to lose.
Feeled for the Aussies and English's fate
Feels very sorry for Australia 🥺
"Australia should be nicknamed as ""The Bottlers of Test Cricket"" 😂😂😂"
I fucking hate the Aussies
Lyon's one over cost many times 😂
A huge respect to that Runner Leach who played Australian pacers like Waal🔥🔥🔥
If umpaire gives out.... It will be a 1 run win for aus.... Sad for them☹️❤
Greatest of all the time
India beats Australia at their own so called fort.... Proud of being an Indian.... Ben defeating Australia here... Proud to be a cricket lover.
The commentary here behind was the one at Radios not on the Television.
"I think Aussies won this, wrong decision at the end."
one man army
From Headingley 2019 to Brisbane 2021
"Ben stokes indeed played a great role but Australia could've easily won the match.
Poor fielding, drop catches, umpire decisions cost them so badly.

take a bow at Kusal Perera's match-winning knock!"
Best test
*L E A C H*
Goosebumps
Ye to IPL se bhi jyada fix thaaaa
Nobody cares if you’re here after India’s win btw
pant and ben stokes.....too much horror for Aussies
What an anecdotes Leach was being appreciated by his stood on Pitch and Stokes was being appreciated by his Heroics on pitch ..it was marvelous!!
Now Gabba one has snatched the thrilled
But this match is more interesting than aus vs ind at gabba
Love Gabba
Best innings in tha world
"Australia, the new world chokers. They get what they deserve. Though, I'm also here after India's historic win ❤."
English always be lucky at this match or final in wc otherwise they lost
Lyon gift this match to english
Last session last day thrillers are ...just that!
"The chills, Goosebumps we get from watching this is just because of the remarkable commentary!
Missing in the Ind-Aus test, similar in fashion, but pathetic commentary! 😔"
Australia has one thing in dna that they are at the losing side of great historic test matches.
The crowd !!!
THE BEST MATCH EVER.......U CAN WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN...!
"But we have to say England were lucky. First the world cup, then this the umpires played their part equally. Not so much in India’s victory though"
Who's here after Rishabh pant magnificent innings 😉
Such a paine in aus😂😂
13:28 it will go down in history as worst and most Expensive review waste
Umpire won the game for england
"At 14:55 ,Stokes was out . wrong decision by the umpire cost Aussies otherwise Aus would have won this ."
Poor captaincy by paine... Ball was clearly pitching out side leg and he took review
Outstanding Performance by Benjamin Stokes......It's the test match which will be remembered for years...
India jayichathin shesham ulla mallus aroke
4:02 changed this match
Ye who is here valo ki gand maro
umpire did his job for england😂
DRS stand for Tim paine z desperate review system....infact in recent Ind- Aus series uska DRS selection bhot bakwas tha....
Ben & Pant two individuals given pain iin Ass for Aussies.. two great innings two series lose for Aussies...
"We can never forget,the best unbeaten single ever made! 
Leach"
भाई ये पुरा युवराज का कॉपी है
"Remember this is England's home ground.... India done this in Australia and that to in gabba without their main players 😇..
Which match is most valuable ?"
"*Jack leach , you're my hero*"
"World Cup final or this Ashes match 
Man this stokes is made of all the luck in the world .
( Overthrow from his bat )
( LBW given not out , and no review available )"
"Aus bowlers can be exposed by Quality Left handers Yuvraj, Ben Stokes, Pant, Sangakara. Aus has Left handers phobia"
Better than a Thriller movie
13:07.. The Worst Review in Test History 😂😂😂😂
joel wilson and dharmsena two unsung heroes for england cricket!
14:36. Imagine what would have happened if the umpire had put his finger on it !!!!🙄🙄🙄❤️👍🏻
lyon still might get nightmares from his run-out chance and missed LBW.
I love England team
If Hazelwood didn't review they would've won
"Australia Choked , Ben Stoked ..."
Ben Stokes is world's best All-rounder 🥰🥰
See Buttler run out
Absolutely unbelievable! Still get goosebumps
Clearly India was inspired by Stokes knock. Enough Indian fans please. Don’t turn a good victory into cringe.
Standing ovation for Leach for defending a ball !! This is epic
Stokes did it better!!
If Australia has review then surely England loose every time England do some kind of cheating to win their was wc and then now but I am very happy for England they did cheating against right team because Australia also did this many times but. Anyway hats off to Ben stokes
Who is here after India’s epic win at the Gabba?
I still believe New Zealand are the true winners of world cup 2019 and over here Ben Stokes was clearly out on that lbw as shown....Note: it's just a opinion of a sportsman that the game should be played in the right way... :(
Ben Pant Stokes
Who else here after India defeated Aus at Gabba in thrilling way..♥️
Ye match sirf Paine ki vaja say hari thi Australia...kyoki Cummins ke mana karne per bhi paine ne galat review liya or jab review lene ka time aya tho Australia ke sare review khatm ho gaye or stokes out tha Lyon ke bol per.😂😂😂
If someone needs motivation in their life then see this❤️❤️
Bad umpiring win England lbw can provide win for aus
Who's here after reading the comment whose here after India's gabba win
Australia ki mar di stock ne
Insane clutch
"Captain America : I can do this all day 
Me : I can see this all day"
Aussie are new chokers
"No-one...
YouTube recommendation -- Ok,you have watched Gabba Test Ind vs Aus 2021...Now you watch Ashes 2019...no u can't skip,you have to watch it..."
Lucky day for ben stoke...he had nothing to lose in that match that's why he performed like this.. I consider pant inning better thn this...
Who is waiting for India vs England 😈😈😈
This was luck. A runout and a lbw missed
And australia drawn the series and retain the ashes 😜 but great batting from leach tho 👏
"To be fair on the umpire that does looked like going down the leg side or barely touching the stumps , but the run out chance was bizarre"
The day when Aussies missed M.Starc the most.
Who came after pant innings here
"Hats off to the umpire who didn't give the lbw, aussies thoroughly deserve it."
Unbelievable
Nathon lyon dropped the ashes
When  the sixth wicket fall australia thought they won
Stokes is well better than pant
17:00 what a camera work
Ben Stokes how could you do this? You are the MS Dhoni of England ! Last man standing and taking YOLO risks ! Greatest test finish in England’s history !
5:22 did he actually miss the ball to hit stump? Out..really???
Whaat a test match
There's a pattern emerging here...🤔
Australian bowlers  did not knows the art of taking wickets of left handers
Can watch this thousands of times❤️❤️
@ 2:35 Stokes hits a six against Cummins... The similar type shot played by Washington Sundar at the Gabba against the same bowler Cummins😅
"Australia sud hav won .....Wrong umpiring and useless Captain of Australia,,"
"Credits to Leach first of all. Second, yes it's too much. Simple as that. Third, if Pat and Tim thought properly before taking the last review ( which clearly was visible was outside off ), then the Nathon Lyon would have been a hero. How the events turned out. It's really a wonder.
Also, go India🔥🔥🔥"
Anyone watching after pant innings 🔥🔥🔥😎
Aus: on England we loss by Stokes on india we loss by pant
Umpire won the match
Rishab pant break this record.. He rescued the team which lost first test and all out for 36 runs.. Then clinch historic tournament against australia 2-1
Tim Payne an idiot. This shows why he doesn’t deserve to be a captain. Taking review for no reason and had none left in very next over when it mattered the most. What an Idiot...
I dont know if he has luck or luck has him!!! What a player!!!
Man of the match could be Nathan Lyon or Joel Wilson :)
Pant bana Stokes 🇮🇳🇮🇳😂😂👍
"Who are here after great match winning innings from Pant at Gabba .....
I knw most of u will be much earlier than me 😃😄"
"Now Australia has a habit lossing matches in this way 
Under the leadership of Tim paine"
Lion lost it. Lion won it. Bad lack Aus. But not at Gabba. 😁
"Australia had so many chances to win. Dropped catches, missed run out chance and no reviews left. That's karma! Aussies"
what a fearless batting by stokes. He changed the gears completely when england was 9 wicket down.. he was only dealing in 6s and 4s which was not an easy approach.. australia could have been crying fowl on wasting one last review on leach but they could have used that against stokes.. this is the real beauty of test cricket.. phew..
Come to india it gonna be ur last series😂
It was not a Day for Aussies.
Poor umpireing otherwise aus wins
"Great Match, great player"
Stokes did exceptionally well but feeling bad for ausies because the droped catches and missed runouts led them to a never forgetting lost 💯
India wins for better than that..
"""who is after""..... Everywhere..😂😂😂"
I can watch it whole day
its a complete entertainment package thriller movie
Poor umpiring decision..
Bhut badhiya
"Once a left handed always a left handed 
Legends will understand this 
#GABBA#"
"The thing, I like the most is the spectators, they appreciate everyone."
Joel Wilson next Bucknor
"After that final over against Carlos Brathwaite, something changed about Ben Stokes! He's then gone on to become one of the best match winners for England. Also his luck in big matches since then has been incredible! Here and also, at the world cup finals ! Luck does favor the brave i guess!"
Best innings all time. Love you Ben from India
At 17:14 just notice nathan lyon at point... rolling on the floor exactly the same way when rishabh pant hit the four at Gabba.....!!!!! Like if u notice
"Still England won it at home not outside home... even india chased 387 against England at home... but is it an achievement??
for me not that much ... even india winning in srilanka and SENA countries winning in each other's country isn't that huge .... but an Asian team winning outside asia is a big thing... and similarly SENA countries winning in asia is huge"
The only match where England want to give victory to Australia but they don't take it
I think this is the best and biggest match in test cricket history 👏👏
Australians to Stoke- 'BenStoke'
Like a dream
Wasn’t Butler not out?
Who is here to add salt to Australian wounds!!!
Pujara was also hit on his helmet by Hazelwood like Ben strokes. @0.06
Not taking anything away from stokes but i genuinely feel he has been super lucky in both his top knocks here and the worldcup finals. He wouldn’t be him if not for the wrong decisions dropped catches missed run outs overthrows etc... a lot has gone in his favor. Just my opinion. Still a good player but all those achievements a lot of fate.
The way they lost this match seems way more painful than the India's Gabba test.  Nathan Lyon has just dropped the match right there 14:03
Left handers are ghosts for Aussies😂😂
"Vaughan : one of the greatest if not the greatest test match ever
Paine: see you at Gabba"
I've seen this a thousand times 🔥
"LOL now there are TWO matches that Lyon has single handedly lost... he’s not a goat, he’s not clutch... he’s a brick"
All because of tim paine who has reviewed that lbw. If they didn't take that review then the result will be different
FUMBLED LYON HAS FUMBLED
"Australia never deserved to win 
1. Sloppy fielding
2. Drop catch
3. Missed run-out
4. Wasting review

Stokes u beauty lots of love from GABBA warriors 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳"
For me the greatest 4th innings test knock of all time
Heroic Inning from Stoke but Poor Umpiring in crucial Time cost a match and series .
Best allrounder of the decade
Match kisi ka bhi ho view India ke hi honge ...hahaha
Tim paine you beauty...Lost against India at Gabba as well...
Please don't compare pant's gabba Innings with this.. Please.. Headingly leagues better
Bad decision by paine he wasted review on leech..
Thriller  I  can't believe it . Like drama in the end if Australia have a review eng might  lost it
"How similar it is to Gabba
Mathew wade takes catch of Woakes and Mayank Agarwal
Nathan Lyon lies down after Stokes and pant hits winning run."
once see what happen the seconds between 2;50 and 3:05
Who's here after doing nothing all day
Who is there after Australia losing at gabba against India
"Stokes was like priorities first 
Not even a bat raise for century
But freak like happy reaction on winning🔥🔥"
"Best ever test match?
Have you seen Ind on Aus border gavaskar trophy 2021 
Best ever series"
If only aus has reviews left.
This will definitely be the most exiting test match ever (Gabba 2021 India vs Aus will be 2nd in my list) . This match was like a movie with all the dramas.
Gibraltar breached of Aussie nd their attitude too🤣😈
what a monster!
"Australia should have one this, they didn't have reviews left and Lyon missed a simple run-out."
Umpire ne wrong decision diya ben stokes lbw tha
The review of the cummins  bowling out of desperation from Paine costed the match.
An  innings to be  remember  forever and ever ....love from🇮🇳
this is too much too much for everyone 14:07 frustration of high level...
"Watch my vlog i make good ones 
Thnks"
"13:56 I think I have watched it more then 50 times to  see everyone's reaction, to feel everyone"
This still gives me goose bumps
Australia was like a lasoon bc mar diya na humne u guys ka tadka... Jai hind 🇮🇳❤️
Nothing beats cricket...no other sport....even the highlights make you nervous...
Is butler really out. !!?
i have seen 2 of the best test matches gaaba and headingly
australians were just unlucky
One word for Australia : Ben Stokes*
That was out man.. Aussies are unlucky really every time Stokes hit a six to Lyon it felt like a mistimed one..
Hey everybody. You you are here after India's victory at Gabba.🔥
16:36 😉🤣🤣
Hazlewwod And PaTty Always Struggle Infront Of the Quality left Handed Batsman . Firstly Stokes and Know Pant Done for their Countries 🔥🔥🔥🔥....This is a Fact .
"That review by Paine at the end was garbage, Cummins was shaking his head but Paine still took it. And how it costed them."
that review from pattinson over cost the match outside leg ..
Spiderman Spiderman .......
Confidence=ben stokes
Out tha nhi diya
"Can't wait for Ind vs Eng, it would be so entertaining 🤩"
i think ind vs aus was the best test(gabba 2021)
2019 and 2021 two test match against australia 2019 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿2021🇮🇳 greatest two test in my opinion.. Unbelievable!!
Run of the century goes to Jake leach 🥳🥳
Best test crowd one could ask for
Stokes was destiny's Child! He had so much chance but he made use of it as well!
Paine take a senseless review in previous over and lyon missed an easy run out......everything gone in the favor of England😄
Even No Movies Scriptwriter can write a better script than this.
No Review left. Run out Chance. Drop catch. Luck weren't favor for Aussies
Just loved the hammering dished out at the Gabba(The so called fortress of Aussies) by this vibrant Indian Team.
Lucky england
There should be recommendation of Ind-aus draw
This called magic.
If Australia had that one review....
Lucky Ben stock Catch drop and wrong time riview  use
14:52 England thanking  umpire after the match 🤣😂😂
BC Kya match tha yar😮👍🏻
Aus ke Gabba me harne ke baad ye kon dekh rha h like kro
Headingley followed by Gabba..... Aussie lads must be munching their own fingers!!
Why is the opposition always Australia😂😂
5:22
14:52 Australia won practically
After watch ind  vs aus at gabba
wish the Gabba butchering by India also had a extended highlight around 20 mins.
I thought this is the best test match until what India did in Australia
Umpire is the man of the match
Poor Paine!!!
"Left handers are a big problem for Aussies aren't they......
Headingly: Stokes
Gabba:: Rishabh pant 
Ohh do I love watching aussies getting knocked over..😁"
Who's here after witnessing the heroics of Pant
Most scariest moment 14:01
back for my weekly viewing lol
any one here after pants innings
"Well, Pant and India have reminded the Aussies of the Pain from Headingly at the Gabba !! Some scripts just cannot be written or predicted. Long live test cricket"
Hmm. The Gabba. Period.
"This looks freakishly like smurf’s playground used for ashes for the gentlemen... However well played both....
As always lucky britishers and vice versa Aussie ..."
"England won in England. India won in Australia. There's a clear difference
If this is heroic from stokes, then its ultra heroic performance from young India to win in Australia against best pace attack of present time"
Joe Wilson should have been prosecuted
Test his very best 😍😍😍😍
who is here after Langer compared the Pant innings to this one.
What a batting... Amazing
Which 1 was the best Ind vs Aus 4th test 2021 or Eng vs Aus this 1?????
I think God was testing the patience of Ben stokes in T20 world cup final coz after onwards god is always helping him to touch his mile stone eg- world final 2019 and this test match
Its ben stokes like perfomance by rishav pant against austrelia now
If you look a bit deeper for all the positive talk Tim Paine has been a bit crap as captain aint he lol.
Tim Paine has been paining in the ass for Aussies for a long time😂
"Who was the reason for Aussies defeat?
Ben Stokes or the Umpire?"
Gotta feel for lyon 😔
This Match is still the greatest of all time
"I still cannot believe that review from Paine!!! Its painful to watch the last LBW not given, such a shame for AUS"
*Pant* 🤝 *Stokes*
This match and India vs Australia at Gabba 2021..  my favourite cricket matches. 🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️♥️
Who's here after India's spectacular show in Gabba😉
Very lucky win for england got away with that lbw call
Never ever take review unnecessarily. They cost big time
Aussies are always on losing side of an interesting match.
"After 286-9 England we are going to win this match
Ben stokes- hold my luck 😂😂
Who is here after the Gabba test❤️❤️"
"Now ind vs aus at gabba
#ripaus😎😎"
"nice show, but he is out by lyon. Aus suppose to win.. poor umpiring.. India victory against aus is the greatest.."
"The best test match ever......
..."
Tim Paine is worst captain for Australia.
"🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳

Australia lost this match coz of paine taking wrong DRS

Australia lost against India coz of paine talking nonsense to indians

Common thing : extra overconfidence in Paine 😂😂😂"
"wow, what a healthy crowd."
Greatest test match ever🧡
Australia tho yaha bhi har rahe h🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lyon missed run out and that asshole umpiring made England win..
That's why you don't waste review Mr Paine. Cost Australia the game here and his dropped catches and missed stumping helped India at Sydney and Brisbane. Worst Australian captain I have seen in my lifetime!!
"England's Ben Strokes
India's PANT

Opponent same : Cheater and Racist AUSSIES"
Goosebumps moment
Any British viewers?
What about Gabba test?
"What a phenomenal match was that, unbelievable 😍👌"
HEADINGLY and GABBA two Greatest test matches of all time.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e1ZjNvItcY
"Who makes him the captain of austrila,  he take review when review was not needed"
Stokes lucky ... catch miss .. runout miss .. poor umpairing ...
"The Australia vs India series too deserved  such a crowd and atmosphere 😢
If not for covid fear and restrictions we would've seen this."
Stokes and pant given a master stroke for Aussie.
What a drama 😂
Empire just cheated Australia
Who is here after India destroy Australia in there Forrest GABA
"I agree this is one of The greatest Test(no starc).. Ben Stoke just wow.. But India With Half Team, New team Done this  vs Australia in Australia against full fledged Aussie Bowling Attack... 👍"
In this match stokes has many luck and luckiest person
"I guess tim paine desperate attempt to take review cost the match easily for aussies.Use your resources at the right time it may be useful at last moment.Kudos to england,they never gave up even till the last ball.Australia who showed fantastic fielding initally ,succumbed to pressure and lost the game. Benstokes has become one man army for england team."
Who is here after watching Justin Bieber's Baby?
Please watch Rishabh panth innings too
Over confidence of Paine leads them to loss the match😂
The 2nd best test match after IND vs AUS at Gabba ! <3 Amazing !
कौन-कौन ऑस्ट्रेलिया और इंडिया का मैच देखने के बाद आया है 😁😁😁😁
"From getting hammered by stokes to getting hammered by pant, Aussies have come a long way but still lost."
who came after watching Ind vs aus Gabba test🙂
"Umpire should have been a little clever here.Knowning Australia has no review left and England has an option,he should have given Ben Stokes out on that ball. If that would have been not out,England would have retained review.That would have ensured a fair play. That is how umpire's think in game of Kabaddi."
Australians missed those 2 chances. Thrilling match it was
The best individual innings in test cricket!!! But the best team effort was GABBA 2021!!!
England was very lucky in 2019. Both in world cup and this ashes match
Main part at 14:22
"Australia will never forget stokes in headingley , and pant in gabba❤️❤️❤️"
Superb
An India repeat this moment  tommarow
This match reminds me of Gabba😀.
just happened on 19th jan 2021
Many of us are here after India's historic win at GABA 😌💘

"I like english audience chant ""eeeyyyy"". Thats sounds awesome"
Who is here after India's greatest won at Gabba?
Pant has done the same job for us . Jai hind ❤️🇮🇳
This ground looks so small
Technically Australia won this game if its not for Tim Paine's arrogance. That was a stupid review.
13:55 😲😲
This match still gives goosebumps
YouTube recommend this after India's Legendary win over  Australia.😂
"Australia did not lose because of Ben Stokes
.
.
Australia lost because of Australia"
Lyon dropped the ashes who agree hit like ?
England is lucky...
Even highlights can give u goosebumps knowing the result..Thats the legacy of this match..long live Test Cricket..
"The Last ""legit"" L.B.W appeal denied by the umpire is the only speck which made this victory a bit ""not great"". Otherwise it's the greatest win indeed."
"14:34 even a kid can say that it is out,, I feel very very very very sad 😰😔😩😭 for Lyon and Australia 🦘🦘"
5:25 wtf?
Wow best mstch
"Aus vs left hand batsman's=🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥stock,washington sundar,Pant😎"

Tremendous victory
Aussies still not learning the mistakes
Stoke one man army
Wow just awesome ❤️
Who is After GABBA Test Match ❤️❤️
"The commentator mentioned that Lyon not only dropped the ball, he has also dropped the ashes... What a statement..!"
Who is after India's magical and historical win in Gabba????
Then England now india destroyed ausies
"Nobody:
Absolutely Nobody:
Indians: Who is here after India breached Australia's pride at Gabba?"
17:10 Nathan Lyon has same reaction as Rishabh Pant finished test Series with four.
"Remember the name always it's
Ben stokes 👏 🙌
Rishab pant 👏🙌
Thank you for giving the best moments in cricket history for all cricket lovers 🙏"
how buttler was given out?
Paine lol waste the review
Bad luck of Australia and lyon too
Best test match I ever witnessed 🤯🤯🤯.....benstockes🙂
"I usually watch this match for mind to be refreshed.
Great match"
Who is here before the 'who is here' comments were spammed?
ISSE PATA CHALTA HAIN KI AUSTRALIA KO MRVANE KI ADAT HAIN INDIA AUR ENGLAND SE
Jack Leach single is the greatest run in Test History... period
RCB faces more difficulty against RR so I don't like stokes
"Indian B team after watching this
Hold our injuries"
One of the best match ever
Ben Stokes... ❤
This is one of the greatest matches.
Thats how important wasting an review cost💥
Excellent Performance By Ben Stokes And Jack Leach And Bad Luck Of Australia 👏
Justin Langer Was Right Ben stokes innings and Rishabh Pant's Innings Destroyed Aussies
"This has to be the greatest test innings ever 👏👏👏👏
Still gives me goosebumps"
Umpire made big mistake not giving plume out when lyon bowling unfortunately Australia finished reviewing.
"14:35 he could have given out, england had a review and was gonna review it anyways, so the decision would have been correct at any condition, stupid umpiring"
Actually aus lost 0:11 here
"Ben stokes in 2019 
And Pant In 2021 , This is something 🔥 💯 
Gaaba grabed ! 🇮🇳"
"The comment section is filled with "" who is here after historic victory of india at gabba "" , which itself describe we love to watch Australia get butchered 😎"
One of the greatest Test match of all time. Getting goosebumps whenever I watch this highlights.
"Am not taking credit away from England... But this was ben stokes vs Australia... But on day 5, they only needed about 200... India's victory @gabba stands taller for a lot of reasons"
"THAT TIME BEN STOKES AND THIS TIME RUSHABH PANT 
NOTE BOTH TIMES WINNING SHOT BY THE MATCH WINNER AND BOTH ARE LEFT HANDED"
I CAN BET THIS TEST MATCH IS FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN WORLD CUP FINALS
"17:06 look at Lyon,history repeated so does his move 😂"
Any one after Gaba fortress breach 🙄🙄🙄😁😁😁😁😁
"𝐴𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑠𝑜 𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑦 𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑡ℎ𝑠 𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑑

"Who's here in the comment section to comment""who's here after India's win at Gabba""😂😂?"
Both Ben and Pant where in similar situations but what Ben went through and taking the team to win is unmatchable
Who else here after India's historical test series win at GABBA
Who is here after Justin Langer compared pant's innings with Ben stokes
Yet another captaincy blunder by Paine. Wasting a review on Leach for a clear not out and not having one left for Stokes. He just breaks under pressure so hard
Who are also watching after India win Gabba test match...hit like
After pant?
Who is here after the fortress of GABBA has been breached by the team INDIA ❤️
Proof if it were needed that Test cricket is the greatest game on Earth
That run out miss by Nathan Lyon looked fishy
"Ben stokes in 2019, Rishabh Pant in 2021, Aussies can't get over freak lefties. Thank you both of you to bury the career of Tim Paine in the ass."
Add India too in list 328
"What if they had not wasted the review 😀
Thats Australia over confindence"
"If yeh toh mere baaye hath ka khel hai had a face
Le left hand - Rishabh pant and stokes😂💪
After today's historic win of India over AUS at Gabba da dhaba...their bowlers ll practice more against left handers😂"
They lost the review when 9 runs needed which is so wasteful instead they could use the review later when stokes is clearly out on Lyon bowling.... less experienced captain 😌
There's something satisfying about watching Hazlewood being hit around and Australia losing because he couldn't get more wickets..
"Tbh half of those shots Ben Stokes played would be out in a bigger ground, hey I'm not complaining tho"
Who is here after  India win test series against australia in Australia by 2-1 ❤️
What a test match this is 😍😍😍😍
"Australia are pretty much used to conceding massive run chases and gifting won matches😅

- Highest and 2nd highest successful chases in test cricket are against Australia. 

- Highest, 2nd highest, 3rd highest successful chases in ODI against Australia. 

- All 3 test victories after made to follow on against Australia. 

- Stokes snatched this game from Australia from the jaws of defeat, chasing 362.

- And finally the bench strength team of India today chased 328 in less than 100 overs at their fortress Gabba. 

So basically India just kept the trend on😅😅🤣"
"Kryptonite of Aussies:
Stokes- Hero of Headingley.
Rishabh- Butcher of Gabba."
Ben stokes has nerves of steel ..omg!
Who is here after pant's innings vs Aus at Gabba
"Australia's Nightmare Left Handers Ben Stokes and Rishabh Pant , whenever these two bat on the Final Day the situation of Australia becomes same as the name of their Captain - Team Pain 😄 🤣 😂"

"Ab yahan koi chutiya likhega ""who is here after indias win in gabba"" aur loda lahsun"
"Last time Umpair do a huge mistake did not allowed conform wicket australia review already lost, anyway 'benstokes' he was a warrior"
"Yes,I am here after Gaba"
"How can you be so civilized after a win like this,?
Lol u guys should have watched the crowd when ind beat Bangladesh on nidhas trophy"
Today was amazingggggggggg last day
IF the ashes has this then the boder gavaskar trophy has Gabba 2021 greatest matches of all time
Umpairing level
Ben stock my favorite 😻 my hero 🥰🥰😻
Virat kohli - bhen xod BEN STOKES ❤️❤️❤️❤️😍
Was buttler really out? Lyon hit the stumps with his hands
India record against england is very poor
"Headingly - Stokes

Today pant is pain 😜 Australian 🧐

That hall mark of Australian team"
Ok enough go and watch GABBA final day🔥🔥
“I dont remember any series where this many batsmen were hit” says the commentator. No problem we got IND VS AUS for you. 😂😂
The most Luckiest person in the history of Cricket is Ben Stokes

Who is here after watching ind vs aus 4th test final day ????
17:11 picture has different fan base
Strokes get all chances at end time to escape including in world cup final with newzeland
"Stokes: off-drive 
Pant: straight drive

For Aussies, it does not make any difference"
This innings is replaced by pant in gabba.... What a match by indians
Two left handed batsmen destroyed Australia one in 2019 by Ben Stokes and in 2021 by Rishab Pant
Australia be like......Ben stokes(BC) aaj to pant ne bhi maar li...😁
"Gabba test vs headingley test ,which is the best test match ever?"
Cummins clearly told Paine not to review. Worst player from Australia. Many matches have lost because of him.
Why only 3 reviews as if someone is going to lose money from it. For every successful review it shouldn’t be counted.
A desperate review cost them a game 🤣🤣 ohh poor Aussies nd Paine
This match will haunt Nathan Lyon for years. The missed run out n the lbw that could have been a out.
Ones a legend said :- meet you in gabba
"Headingley and Gabba 
Dejavu"
Anyone here after india's win at Gabba . Pant and Stokes are superstars.

India win the series against Aus and YT suggest me this video. DEJAVU  😂😂 YT trolling AUS-Cricket
Who's here after Rishabh Pant won the game for India? Really loved his batting!!
This time its Rishabh pant❤️
And the aussies have done it again
"Who’s here after India’s legendary win over aussies
Gabba jinx broken"
He is the really no. 1 all rounder.
"Who watched AUS Vs IND 3rd test...?
Give a like👍"
Lion ne galti ki umpare ne galti ki pain ne galt review janbhujh kr liya
2 time Australia is won tha mach bat  Lyon is 😭 day
Sir Benjamin Stokes. Give that man a knighthood
it was bad luck for Australia
When ECB noticed that most of the commenters are from India
The match was lost when Paine took a review in desperation for Leach. It could have been used for Ben Stokes for the LBW. I feel for Aussies for the bad decision by the umpire.
I can't ever  see any match  like this.....
I don't know how many times ben stokes have done it for England 🙏🙏🙏
This is dream match
This is the most amazing cricket crowd i have ever seen in Test cricket!!🔥
it shows tim pain is chutiya from starting...
"Best single run in test cricket history 
Leach 1 run (17 balls) ❤❤"
Match of the century
Match fixing?? 🤔
17:11 beautiful scene in the history of cricket
Kal india ka match hai aaj isko dekh ke confidence le aate😂😂😂
It's not a win .😅😂
Nice bating
"Karma says it all
Lyon deceived Buttler run out, then he missed an easy runout of Leach last moment"
Stokes had luck in his breakfast :)
What a player
wow wow you beauty
I watch it live my god greatest innings in my life I saw
Cinematic & Cricket shot of the Century 17:00
If only India Can replicate this tomorrow we will win the series.
I want ind to this in 4th test
Stokes👍👍👍👍👍💐💐💐💐💐💐
Happy go Lucky😇👍
Australia lost when pat cummings ask paine for review and when lyon lost the opportunity of runout .
Favourite and best match winning batting inning ever 💥☝️
"Someone: Test Matches are boring....
Ashes: I'ma end this man's whole boredom :)"
"Commentator saying ""Bhenchod you beauty"" 12:05"
"As an Australian, watching this match late into the night definitely brought back vibes from 2005 Ashes. The tension was palpable. Stokes' performance was purely herculean. On the other side, the Australians would have been devastated that they let this slip. Straight after the match i predicted that they would end up winning the next match and clinching the series because of the emotional contrast in both camps. The Aussies would have immediately gotten to work on rectifying this calamity. By contrast, England looked like they celebrated hard after this and probably depleted themselves for the follow up game a week later."
Jeet ka name Bin Stokes
Ben stokes all time greatest cricketer...he achieved dreams
"Channel - england
Match:aus vs eng 
Comments -Indian......"
Plumb LBW not given. Tim Paine shouldn't have wasted the review.
Stokes single Handedly destroyed Aussies
I am missing Nasseer Hossain commentary in this stage. No one can make it more exciting than Nasser Hossain.
"My next favorite player, after MS"
😵😵😵😵
Awesome.. naseeb bc..
13:55 was the moment where aussies lost the match
Seems like a drama written by Shakespeare
"9:22
Australia need 1 wicket to win
Stokes: are you serious??!!?"
Such was the INTENT of Stokes even Umpire couldn't raise his finger.... WHAT A INNING
There is big luck for england
This is the GREATEST EVER TEST INNING AND MATCH. PERIOD.
England bhot vdiya khela par last umpayar dessison galat tha

"Greatest finish ever....🤙🤟✌🔥🔥🔥 Ben Stokes💥💥😘💪💪💪💪💪
Never Give Up....🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿"
Better drama than most tv shows.
I think by the time he retires he will be one of the greatest English cricketers. It is really inspiring how he has improved during the course of his international career.
Brilliant ben 👏👏👏
Dislikes are Aussies 😂
One of the best inning of Ben stokes 👍👍
Remember the name sir Benjamin Andrew Stokes ❤️🔥
"I don't usually watch the Ashes but I feel this was one of the most amazing cricketing moments ever. Look at the crowd, the pressure, the hits and the reaction after victory. Truly amazing ❤"
@17:00 no cricket fan can forget that camera shot❤️
1000times I watch this match
"ben stokes is a brave man & hence fortune favours the brave stands true for him because of the way luck favoured him & England in wc final as well Ashes final test. I feel he would succeed a number times further due to his bravery & would endup being ""Sir Ben Stokes""!!"

I love you BS
Legends say Australians are still busy in making fake accounts to dislike this video 😂😂
A very biased commentary. Is the video only for UK ?!
Have watched hundreds of time.
Tim Paine ki aadat hi aisi hai ya toh review hi nahi leta aur agar leta hai toh galat samay par leta hai 😂😂😂
it' was a fixed match
That's the reason why Virat kohli always uses his name
Ben Stokes is the player of the century
This is the beauty of a Test match
Man of the match goes to (Umpire) joel wilson.
"This match is an example of how misfielding causes a great disaster....
Also an example of Luck Factor which determines some success"
Paine need paractemol like stokes
Stokes steel the game
JPKISH2KL
*Worst Umpiring ever seen in history*
Who is here after Shardul & Sundar 50
"I mean how stokes took away the game fantastically, gorgeous, tremendous etc."
"Best fighting teams against Australia 
1) England
2) India"
"Stokes celebrating there with hands wide apart and the crowd giving him a standing ovation in the background 
... Gives me one hell of a goosebump. Brilliant work by the cameraman."
That's called.: किसी चीज को दिल से चाहो तो पूरी कायनात उसे मिलने में लग जाती है।।
This shows that 2019 was Golden year for England. not because they played the best but because Lady Luck shined on them throughout. be it the 2019 WC. be it the Headingly Test. uff
14:00 He Just Dropped the Ashes!
Comment करने वाले हम indian ही होते है 😀
"Leach also played a great role 
Stokes ❤"
Class shots
This test match proves why nathan lyon can't be in a t20 team
Gooosebumps
"what a match , best test ever , benjamin stokes the boss"
India walo kuchh sikho aur thodi achchhi strike rate ke saath khrlo
"From giving 4 sixes in T20 wc to winning 50 over wc and ashes.
Ben stokes=never give up."
My hero for All My love Ben
0:12 & 15:23 Don't mess with Sir Benjamin Stokes .
"I think this match i
Was fixed"
Stokes a legend
I think Ben stokes Is the best hero off his country
And the men of the match given to Lyon. 🤣🤣
What a cricket!
Last LBW😂😂😂😂
There is a reason why virat kohli remembers him everytime things get tough
13:57  Aussies should have won at that moment
No. 1 😘😘😘
That's why stockes is my favourite eh ground pe rehta h toh hamesa akele dam par match jita deta ha
Super hero stokes
"THAT MATCH..ITS 11:50pm on 16th JAN,2021 IN KOLKATA,INDIA..STILL GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS!"
"Watta test match, this match brought life to test matches, and of course ben stokes, watta an inspirational performance"
0:11 ... aus lost here😂😂😂
N
Undoubtedly this is the epic test match in the history of test cricket if you analyze  from every aspect ......although  Australia will always regret for wasting that review...
It's more like T20 match
.https://youtu.be/vPgQv1ouMBM
"Aus won by 1 run but umpire gave wrong decision ,LBW"
21th century's best match
Missing chances when 2 runs needed.. You didn't deserve ashes then
"last 2 runs lbw is out but umpire's give him not out it's a dirty thing in cricket , always maintain rules & regulation if ball hitting wicket then it's out no reviews matte
 kohli :- ben stocks😂"
Good match to watch shame the umpire made the shittest call of his career on the big stage of his career.
If paine hadnt wasted that review the result would have been painfull.
What on earth is roy doing there in test team.
Those cheers were even more louder than those when brock returned back to wwe.
That’s the greatest 1 run ever in cricket history by leach
Best test match ever seen
What a match
Legend innings #$tokes
"And man of the match goes to ""umpire"""
"These fuckers won everything on umpires' mistakes, and that bastard Stokes is the luckiest cricketer ever, be it this, be it the CWC 2019 final."
Decided by one bad umpiring decision 😂
Umpire should give favour to the  team who don't have review for 10th wicket. If Umpire would have given stokes out Eng would have reviewed it.. if it's not out they would get back the review else it's out.
"If Vihari ki jagah 
Rishabh Pant 160 balls khel jatha toh gand faar detha Australia ki 
Eshe hi same"
Boi oh boi this man is a god damn psyshopath stokesy whats ur meal lad❤️❤️ hands down the best cricket can deliver 👍🥂
Stoakes expressions❤️❤️❤️
Best innings after kusal pereras 150
The review that was unnecessary...
"Shame on the umpire srsly it was a no brainer disgusting man ,but ben stokes must be worshipped there srsly this man has breathtaking potential 🎯🎯🎯🥂🥂🥂"
"2 Heroes of the match 
1- stokes 
2- English crowd"

This may be the best ashes test match ever and one of the best knock ever by a batsman in a test match that i have ever seen. Well played Ben Stokes 👍👍👍👍
"Most incredible nd entertaining match evr in the history of test cricket🔥☄️..

"God be like- maa chudaya aus,jeetaunga to england ko hi😅🤣🤣🤣"
Another match won by england's paid umpires

Lord Benjamin stokes
"Oh that review @13:21, run out missed & wrong decision by umpire in the end."
This innings made Ben Stokes more Popular in India than in England.........

England kismat se jeeta
I am here for 16:38 😂
Very #bad day for #Austraila
This is one of the best cricket match we will ever witness....
"Football is fun.
Bloody hell this is lit, the result can be predicted in almost every game except this beautiful game.
Thanku England for bringing this to world."
Joe Root and Joe Denly deserve as much credit for their gritty innings on Day 4.
"Followed this on TMS on a beach in Cornwall (there was no WiFi). A small group of people were having a BBQ on a rock, they were only vaguely interested in the cricket. I, as a disheartened fan, asked the man with the radio every so often what the score was and when Bairstow then Woakes were out, no one had any hope really. But when Stokes started bidding it about and the afternoon progressed, more and more people crowded round, until near the end there were so many that the owner of the radio had to relay events as they happened. Every six that looked like he was going to be caught and then Agnew told us he was still there...  When Lyon missed the run out, suddenly we started to believe it was possible. And when Stokes hit the winning four, it seemed like the whole beach erupted. It will remain one of the most exciting day's cricket of my entire 50 year fandom, the others being the WC final but a few weeks earlier, Edgbaston 2005 and, of course, Headingley '81, though that was different because England weren't chasing then of course. There really is nothing quite like the climax of a 5-day test match in the rest of sporting world, when the balance between defeat and victory is so, so fine, and when everything up to that point has been leading to this exquisite but unbearable climax. Though I suppose every sports fan says that of his chosen sport. But the tension on the beach with the radio was monstrous, the cheer at the end ecstatic. A group of strangers on a summer's day, suddenly united in their joy! Quite unbelievable, even for a diehard cricket fan like me. Stokes was absolutely incredible that day. The odds against him achieving that were immense. He needed luck, of course, but somehow he deserved it. Unforgettable. Unique. Incredible day..."
"Pant after watching this:
Had it I been behind the wickets, Lyon would not have missed that run out chance.
""He just needs backing""
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Wonderful moment
Can anyone explain me Buttler runout lton doesn't have ball in his hand while hitting wickets.🙄
Aaj BHI bahut apsos ki baat hai Indias srif khud ki team KO passand karte hai na ki cricket KO Indian cricket KO Pasand karta to yeh video pe Sab se Jyda like or views hota
There were some luck for Stokes but he deserves those; the remarkable innings he has played simply will remember for life time
"Deviliers fastest hundred and this hunred by stokes are favourites of me..,,,brvae innings by both but at no 1 stokes hundred because he was fighting alone"
"What a sound of stokes bat,,i love it"
What a match watching whenever i felt low ♥️
"What a fine all rounder,,amazing hitting wow,love from pak"
I can see more Yuvraj singh kinda attitude from Ben Stokes in this innings. Especially those pull shots were lit 🔥🔥🔥
Unbelievable..ben stokes you beauty 😍
Ben Stoke is a very good innings of all time
"9:22 commentator said that Australia closing on victory here ,and results are different so dont judge too early"
Unbelievable  absolutely awesome test ever
One of the best test match ...
"Ben stokes

Run out missed.. no review left cost aus the match
"Faith can move mountains

Untold innings by Ben superb thrilling victory 😘😘😘
Australia simply wasted the review
One of the greatest test match
Truly Incredible.. What an innings...
Fuckin goosebumps man🔥
The way he played.....to score his 1st fifty in 150 balls  and next hundred in just 60 odd balls.....turned the game upside down.....take a bow Benjamin stokes
"Wilson should have given that out, even if he had any confusion in his head. If it would have been not out, England would have reviewed and got it in their favour."
If someone ask you why you love cricket then simply show them this match
Ben Stokes played one of the greatest innings but in the end that was out 14:33
It is beauty test cricket...
"Stokes played one of the best innings of alll time.
Leach scored one of the greatest singles of all time."
"No matter how many times I see the world cup final or this match.
One thing remain common is the luck of Ben stokes is just one of the greatest.
No doubt he deserves all the appreciation but same do his luck as if I was there in England squad with even a weaker heart I would definitely have got an heart attack.
As he is the one that has a talent to keep his nerves down in these situations and that make him so special"

"Who the F**k says test cricket is boring.
This is the best form of cricket anyday"
Australia had this match won but for some silly umpiring
Hardwork patience never giving up attitude + luck
My best allroundre stokes
How many drops and miss fields. Oh my god. Lyon missing runout 🙄. Aussies won the match for England along with stokes. Luck favours
Best test ever.😀
This only happens between England or Australia
Kya match oh Australia or England oh nathan lyon run-out oh lbw wrong decision oh review waste
Bauaa :- ben Stokes 😂
Nethan lion cheater karma hits u back 😂😂😂
Waiting for next game of cricket for this scenario
Unbelievable
What a match
england all matches were mostly fixed including world cup final 2019
nathan lyon didnt  want to run out leach
The excitement of crowd is next level 🙌😄
In this match Australians became choker
What a test✌️✌️✌️
Adbhut pari thi Bhai
"Man, trust me i had a goosebump rush for 1 minutes straight"
"Such a poor captaincy by Paine. If he hadn't wasted that review on leach lbw , he would have used it for Ben stokes in the lbw appeal of previous over which was of Lyon & Australia can win this. But ....😂"
Australians give them match
Ban took 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌❤🤛🤛🤛🤛🤛
Ben Stokes is new age Flintoff 👍
I've been watching this innings again and again and will continue to watch it again and again
"Rare,Very Rare When England crowd cheering and screaming like India's Crowd🌟😄🔥🔥🔥🔥"
"Stokes🙏🙇‍♂️... Take a Bow,Hats off to you💥"
Anyone here who is seeing it for the first time
किश्मत हमेशा बहादुर का साथ देती है
I saw this match livr   this is the best match my life like wc final
World's greatest allrounder
Ashes in England is the best
What a pathetic review by Cummins and Paine.. they surely knew that pitched outside leg..
ENGLAND CAN NEVER WIN WHITHOUT UMPIRE FAULT
"Stock vs Aus
Vihari vs Aus
👍👍👍👍"
Stokes is no.1 allrounder in the world
Australia took how much money to loose the match. Haha 😄 🤣 😂
Watching More More & more 🙈
Man of the match -Umpire😶
13:21 worst mistake of Australia in their history.
Good performance Ben Stokes
"I have never seen any Sports team get luck so much than England in 2019-20. 
Lyon, last lbw oh god...
Ben stokes is LUCKMAN"
"Oh man 😆 Nathan lyon, i feel for you.."
my best test match
"16:39 the guy’s face!
😂😂😂"
"FORTUNE FAVOURS THE BRAVE
example BEN STOKES"
Why Was Butler given rujout there???..Lyon dint grab the ball and hit the wicket with both hands??  Any idea why?
Incredible
"this is not a great chase. vvs lakhsman added more than 100 against a better aussie team in indian conditions and it was mostly chanceless. There is no body in the history of cricket punking aussies like lakhs did: calcutta, adelaide, bombay and that chase.
some indians have dominated aussies boht in one day and test formats: yuvi in one dayers, gautam in tests at home, kohli in both one day and test at home and abroad against aussies, dravid has his day, lakhs, shewag and tendulkar.kl rahul has had great outting against aussies,pujara and now latest being pant! even dhawan has scored centuries against aussies( both in india and abroad: test and one dayers), ganguly also showed up. that is heck of a list."
"great effort but aussies goofed up in run out and umpire totally goofing up, plumb it was . that is why you dont put restrictions on drs. use them to get it right period.
anyways aussies won the next match."
And then there are indian fans who are happy just for the draw....shows the difference in mentality
Benstocks😄😄😄
Who came before gabba test
What a Match!!!
Man I enjoy watching this evertime as a new match
I think 90% viewers are from India🇮🇳..........
Nathan Lyons ball was clearly out
How many notice yeah the victorious shout from the commentator 😁😁
This actually won by australians . Umpires decision ..
"13:45 that attitude , that confidence , sums  his greatness"
Who are here in 2021
Who are here in 2020
"Poor fieldings always play vital role and cause for defeat. Drop catches, worst run out miss. Then poor umpiring. Stokes played brilliantly in front of his home crowd with good support from umpair and Lyon at crucial time.😁😁 Rohit made 264 in odi with 3 drop catches... Poor fielding n umpiring are the major cause to create history. I appreciate the team who plays well in away test match with even bad umpiring. Away matches are really difficult to win."
That's why I love cricket more than any sports ❤️🙌🙂
"Ashes 2005 Freddie with the ball
Ashes 2019 Stokes with the bat"
"14:00 mistake of decade by player
14:55 mistake of decade by umpire"
16.45 🔥
17:13 camera shot tho........respect the cameraman
Moral of the story - keep that review for last ball
"If I am dying and God ask me my last wish, I am gonna ask for this match..
Watches so many times.."
This is so satisfying I can watch this on loop  ❤️🔥🔥
English people are good audience for Test matches.... Admiring this..
1:04 Wow AB is watching match while having a burger
Perfect example of pressure 😖# runout lbw catches dropped
Ben stokes + Luck= Unstoppable
"Very well played england 

Love from Australia 🇦🇺🇦🇺"
One of the greatest knocks ever in test cricket history
"What a match 
What a player Ben Stokes 
Poor Australia 😂"
"Wow wow wow. Take a bow Ben. Any point of time you feel low in your life, go and watch this video.
I wish I could be there to watch this live."
"Word of appreciation for editor, truly editors from ECB and Aus cricket doing the fine job."
Karma played the role for aussies
"THAT WAS JST ENGLANDS DAY
NOTHING ELSE"
I can watch this match 101 times without getting bored
Goosebumps.
BEST EVER TEST IN CRICKET HISTORY ❤❤❤❤

Best all rounder is Ben stock in world right now ❤️ Love from India 🇮🇳 lot of times he won games for England ... world cup also 👍
Australia choked I watched it live how many chances they had to just finish the game England just got lucky as they always do and Ben stokes is not even an Englishmen
Scripted
After winning this match Ben stokes yelling his own name  Ben stokes.
Jo Wilson played important role in this match  for England
Oh Ben stokes
Miss chances
Aba aus jeet jati bae catches drop nhi karti toh
This is my stress buster
2019 was the year of Ben Stokes 🔥🔥🔥
Sometimes you just have to say well played Ben stokes. Well played
Eng was very lucky in this test and WC final vs nz.. 🤞🤞
Ben-Strokes 😂
Great match
This is moment.my love from india Ben you are real hero.and one of this best cricketer in this planet ❤️❤️❤️❤️
what a player
0.11 Thoppi therijiruchi.......
Nothing more satisfying that seeing the Aussies loose😂👊
excellent match but aus lost because of the wrong descision
"A lot in the match 
Cannot be described"
That drs taken by AUS 😂😂😂 such a pathetic decision
Wowww this is greatest test match in the history of cricket
Eng can show this performance at homes only. I think they are going receive a whitewash in IND.
i watched this game live. greatest knock in a winning cause. BEN U LEGEND ALREADY AFTER THIS MATCH
Australia deserve this type of defeat
Incredible performance by Ben Stokes👌🏻👌🏻
Wish  long live.... Test matches..
It's like fricking thriller movie!
See the faces of Kangaroos
Only Ben and Mahi can do that impossible.
This could be best slap to Australian's ego ever
Player ho to😁iske jaisa❤️ben
who is here after INDIA 🇮🇳 vs australia draw
"This man! This man made a match out of nowhere. What a player he is! 
Respect."
That last replay of stokes celebrating and crowd rising...  Gives me goosebumps everytime i watch it
"If India have same target instead of 407 in 3rd test vs Aus, India would easily achieve it"
I can watch this whole day  !
"T20 cricket is entertainment🔥
But, test cricket is emotion❤️❤️"
Incredible knock by Ben Stokes 🔥
"This is best test match ever but not the  best test innings.the best test innings was kusal perera's 153 against South Africa
Ben stokes- massive croud sapport/advantage of the country/ runout miss chance/ umpairs mistakes/ dropped catch 
Kusal perera- only his ability"
"4 things I would like to point.....
1. Test match is the toughmost format.....winning a match like this can keep thousands of IPL titles aside
2. Performance of a lifetime for Ben Stokes...just like Carlos Brethwait 4 sixes off him
3. Jack Leach gave a stupendous support at one end to allow Stokes free his arms....he is equally important
4. Aussies......pathetic DRS decision coupled with rubbish  fielding

And the umpires not to forget....they made upteenth mistakes in the entire test"
Without any doubt this has to be the ICC Match of the Decade
"""Ben stokes"" kya khela hai 😜😜"
Hail ben stokes
"stokes didnt celebrate his century , he knew he might pull it off ."
I think Australian players are trying to Injured any player
Who said test cricket is boring
One like for leech... Unsung hero of match
"17:10 best moment, tough cricketer is always looking for"
Far far better then ......10  T20 matches 😁
This match is greatest I've ever seen
"What a chess
Ben Stokes"
What a innings by Ben stokes
Who See in 2021 😎
That's what we say fixing is🤣🤣🤣...script🤣
"8:37 on our Mobile Display shows that Australia need to win 2 Wicket....
England be like- Ruko jara,sabar karo😂😂😂😂😂"
Ben stokes ...... great respect 🔥🔥🔥🔥
"Ben stokes, u r my hero!"
I am watching this 20th times ... Unbelievable
Awesome... uff life
Ben Stokes one of the greatest innings of all time.
"There's no difference between this and 🇮🇳IND - AUS 🇦🇺 test match draw (2021). Here it was benstokes abd tail enders , there it was HANUMA VIHARI & RAVICHANDRAN ASHWIN. I would probably say After ASHES, BORDER - GAVASKAR TROPHY IS THE BIGGEST RIVALRY IN WORLD CRICKET.

Edit : who's here after the EPIC SAVE (DRAW) by India against Australia?"
Probably greatest match after VVS's 281 scored match 👍❤️ Stokes u beauty 🙏
15:22 my gosh that was some loud pop 👍
I still regret not watching this live.... Definitely match of the decade
"Ben played superbly. However, Aussies tanked this big gime, they crumbled under pressure massively. Dropped catches, missed easy run-out chances, taking wrong DRS at the heat of the moment. Ben was lucky, really lucky to take them home. As a neutral fan, this was one hell of a memorable match. It is bacause these matches, this format of cricket is being called so a ""TEST"" match."
Not only this match or ining but ben stokes had that whole year
Test is best !! And in this match at his extreme best!! Nail biting match !!
Who is here after INDIA🇮🇳-AUS🇳🇿 legendary drawn match?
England crowd is the best
Goose bumps stuff🔥🔥🔥 B'Sks
"It's a Win match Australia,because in last of the match they don't have review and Umpire gave it not out where Actually it is Clean hitting the stumps and out........the worst decisions of umpire got Australia loss the match.....But good effort by Ben Stokes......."
Cheaters aus...
Who's here after Sydney test 🇮🇳🤜🤛🇳🇿😃
Who's here after India's historic draw against Australia?
Anyone there in 2021?
"Whos here after india pulled off amazing test to draw at SCG on 11 jan,21"
"15:21
And there you go"
"Don't know how many times i watched this! Just loved it...❤️

Love from India"
Imagine a test championship final like this.
"It's Jan 11,2021 today, and India drew a fantastic match with Australia today of Border Gavaskar trophy...I have to say that if one player like Stokes hv had been in our Indian team then we wd have won today's match as we were chasing the target of 407"
If pant not out today then Ausies cryies once again today😂😂😂😂
BCCI should have its own YouTube channel 🙏🙏🙏
"2 dropped catches and bad fielding of lyon 
Always stokes comes with a great luck"
who thought that someone's comment will be there like... who is here after india 🇮🇳 vs aus  🇦🇺 match.. 🙃 haha 😂
Feel srry for aus 🤦🏻‍♂️😔
Best match ever
Ben Stokes alone entertains more than whole England cricket team.
For me watching Stokes' batting on youtube is more entertaining than buying Netflix subscription.
Wow great but not better than india who defend todays match in australia against aus with an injured player and other a bowler.This is also one of greatest against Australia
Ben stokes is a lucky player  THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN OUT LBW 😜😜😜& BEST ALL ROUNDER OF MODERN ERA with NEVER GIVE UP ATTITUDE 👊👊👊👊
"If only they didn't waste the review on Leech, they would have won.. Never the less it's the best 4th test innings ever (Close second is Nathan Astle innings against England)"
Goosebum......😲
Whos watching this after see aus  vs ind
Best finisher today

Ben stokes is a legend for england
5 star match and one of the greatest ever
The last single by Jack Leach in this match and the single Ntini had taken in the last over when South Africa's never forgettable 435 chase against Australia - These 2 will remain as the most valuable singles in the history of cricket. Only real cricket lovers will realize it😌
Greatest match ever..and a greatest knock of the century but ya it was totally Australian match due to wrong umpiring or miss field they have lost the match
A Complete test
Last 30 runs😳😳😳😳😳
What a fantastic innings benstocks really good climax...
One of greatest ashes match ever
Tomorrow Vihari In Scg 🤞
Umpire loses eyesite to give loss to Aussie. England were playing with 12 player  .
One man army
What a game
"Now india have to chase 300 runs in Sydney test on 5th day against Australia,but there is no batsman like ben stokes, so it's impossible
EDIT:- I AM HERE AFTER THE MATCH 
INDIA DON'T HAVE BEN STOKES 
BUT INDIA HAVE 
DEFENSE OF PUJARA
AGGRESSIVENESS OF PANT
CLASS AND PATIENCE OF VIHARI
INTENT OF ASHWIN"
Stokes 🔥🔥🔥
"""An inning that keeps the Ashes alive."""
I wish India Play like this and beat Aussie in test...
Incredible match
Stokes is incredible
17:10 love that reaction from crowd
90percent luck 10percent ...effort from stokes..how many u agree
https://youtube.com/shorts/UhIEyx3TZEA
Australia ye haar kabhi nahi bhuulega
Wat a player's ban stok after wachin india aus series
It's better than any suspense thriller of all time ❤❤🙏🙏
"Stokes was plumb when needed 1 run, umpire cheated?"
The LBW decision was probably right. If you see closely impact is slightly to the left of where the ball pitches. So the projected line should have been a lot straighter and not curling into the stumps. Given that it was a spinner the ball would not have swung in the air as it is shown on DRS. I think DRS took into consideration also the second impact on the back leg. That ball at best was clipping the leg stump.
Mark Nicholas made it more epic
Admiring the inning of leach also
"Not only the match is one of the greatest, even the commentary is complimenting it, every word Mark Nicholas uttered can be made into a saying."
Cricket is not a game its an emotion ❤️
What an amazing crowd
Can you imagine if Joe Wilson gave that LBW out
I was in the crowd 😍best match ever if you think same like
"You can see clearly at around 13:13 Pat cummins is responsibly and confidently conveying to the captain its not out and not to take the review, but Paine still goes ahead"
"Between this and the ICC WC final montage, hard to say which is the best cricket video ever"
"I cannot imagine how Paine( last review wasted), Harris(dropped catch), and Lyon( missed piece of cake run out) woulld have felt after losing the game!"
"What cave have i been living in!what did i just see and how was i not aware of this incredible match..oh my goodness, ben stokes will go down as the greatest all rounder in the history of the game"
Australia should not have wasted reviews
it was the aus who won the match if umpire did not given the wrong decision
Best ashes match ever ever seen wwoohooo
Ben stokes be like amir khan of lagan...and leach as a kachra...thanks for the thrilling moments..test is the best..
"I was following the test match but only that particular day , I decided to watch whole day of play and yes ! my  love for test cricket was redeemed that day 👍👍"
17:00 is a better shot than any sports movie could ever hope to set up
Monster is ready to attack in nonstricker end....till 9 wicket fall then it 🔥 🔥
It was Stokes' day. Luck was favouring him. He was taking too many risks.
I love the way Stokes didn't celebrate his 50 and 100 as he knew that the bigger task is still ahead... winning!
"9:19 Why wasn't it given ""Umpire's call""? He would have still been out but still... what's with the Hawk Eye?"
So sweet crowd sound😍
"Everytime I feel something is impossible,I come back to this video and this keeps me motivated ❤️."
7:30 😂
When stokes plays he plays a very big innings if not he gets out on a duck.
I haven't seen this type of innings in my life. WOW! Truly unbelievable
England team would have run towards the ground
Yeaaaassssssssssss That voice doesnt bore me anytime i watch this innings
England = advantages
One of the best test match that I ever witnessed.....
I  could watch this a million times and not get bored!!!!!
"12:00 - I think Mr. Nicholas summed this day up pretty well.
Hope you guys are all well and good."
Goose bumps... Moments 🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍
"My father saw 86's Maradona.
I see 19's Ben stokes ."
Kachra khelega😂😂
It is looking like a movie climax😂😂 or a fixed match.
Super
Mark my word this inning will be inning of the century.
this is all time best test match finishing
This is one of the best test match every played in history 🙌
It reminds me of the world cup final. Luck favours the brave personified. Every shot he played Australia  had 4 chances to win this match
https://youtu.be/g_LFvR0dhYU
Virat is the only one who praise benstokes in all match
"This is called #TheAshes. It's not just a test match, all three formats(Test, ODI, T20)
of cricket  can be seen in this match, that's why Ashes is a very special one to me,.The unique one. ✌️✌️"
everyone is complementing stokes for his innings which he deserves but no one recognized the defence of Jack leach
Nathan Lyon would have been some serious depression after this match
O bhai ben stokes is beauty
Lyon dropped the Ashes.
Only one word .... behn chtokes
Lajawab stokes (kayal kar diya yaar)
Literally watching this for the 500th time
Test cricket man!!!
A slap to them who says test cricket is boring 🤦‍♀️
"Amongst everything going on in the world and in the UK at the moment, this video never fails to make me zone out and remember this iconic innings"
"When commentators said after Root wicket, that ""and with that is it the ashes ?
Ben Stokes: Hold on, Remember My Name, I too play for England"
Ben Stokes is a fantastic cricketer. And one lucky bastard!
"Aus - we are win
Leach - hold my 1"
Man that umpire
"This innings will be regarded as one for the ages. Ben Stokes, you beauty!"
This kind of innings will be remembered for long time. Ben stokes you are the true gem of world cricket.
One of the greatest match I ever watched
"So many missed chances, so many half chances gone down of stokes

If destiny is true, this is a prime example"
"""The greatest one of all time"" what a line sir❤️"
So good this video says that  how good is ben atokes
Beautiful innings
The greatest test match I have ever seen.
"Remember the name ""BEN THE STOKES"" 💥💥💥💥"

If you play this at 23:44:36 on New Year’s Eve Ben Stokes will hit the winning runs at exactly midnight.

Ben Stokes the man 😎😎the superstar 👍"
"England is the Luckiest team in the world every single thing goes their way  particularly against Oceanic countries 😂😂...wc , Ashes. No doubt they are a great team.But this is unbelievable .Its  like a scripted movie by nature. Shocking."
What a match ..what a player ..and wat a bad luck of Australia's.......they take last review when they 90% know it was not out but still took a chance as match was abt to finish ......and when stokes was really out AUS didn't have left any review ..........and a simple runout chance they missed ......that is why it is said it's never over till it completely over .....but grt performance bt Stoke superbly won match single handedly ..wow......just wow
17:10 is the best scene

"Stokes vs aussis🔥🔥🔥
Match of the decade
Test innings not the history 👍"
"Well he can retire now, he already played the inning of his life!"
"Stokes "" Kaala jadu krta bhai "" 😀lol  Hamesha lucky hai, sirf batting K wakt"
Aussies must have understood the true value of DRS
Ben Stokes's this Innings is the 2nd best test innings ever after Kushal Perera's Innings at South Africa against South Africa....
Last run bhag kachara  bhag..
5 runs incident+ Ben Stokes bat carry=England's breathtaking win
The greatest test match of England history 👍👍👍💐🇮🇳
"Baooa will be like .. kay khela h ""ben strokes
"" 😂"
"Meanwhile:
Aus has won 3 times 14:53 , 13:58
12:23 😆😆😆"
Most epic test match 🔥🔥🔥
Deny all you want but Ben Stokes has the similar back lift as Yuvraj Singh
Best allrounder
This match is written in history
"Greatest ""1"" of all time.."
Whatta player.... Whatta knock.... Whatta match. Unbelievable. Goosebumps all around.
What A player
Goosebumps ❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
no 1 test series in the world the second is border gavaskat trophy
Match of a century 🔥❤️
England deserve but they got bit lucky misfield and umpire horror

Most beautiful thing ever seen 😍
"Crowd needs to be more passionate , just go and watch the video of asesh 2005 test match where England won by 2 runs crowd was jumping !!!"
Greatest inning ever? Kusal perera will be laughing with shaking his ass😂
Kah ke gaad leli aus ki😂😂😂😂
ক্রিকেট টা ইংল্যান্ড আর ইন্ডিয়ার জন্যই
"Ben you really a brave heart, like mel gibson was in the movie but you are in real👍👍👍👍"
Very closely this comment only Australia bad luck.....
Why i see most of comments from indian😂
"England had many lucky to win this test and world Cup also,"
"When luck is in your side.
1. Catch miss
2. Aus review wasted
3. Easy Run out missed
4. Clear Lbw denied by umpire and Aus don't have any review becoz they already wasted 🤣
5. Well played Ben Stokes..always luck favours the brave 👏"
Give that umpire man of the match😂
Is the best test match or World Cup final match much interesting crowd
I think 2019 was an year where Ben could even score 40 runs of an over.
One man army
Plot twist-The match is played between England and Australia but most of the comments are by INDIANS 😎😎😎
Credit goes to umpire... LOL umpire
Gem of England cricket
"I had a question- ""why is buttler out bcz the ball was not in lyon's hands when the bails were dislodged. He had not gathered the ball and dislodged the bails without the ball. So buttler should be not out""."
THAT WAS A GOOD LUCK FOR ENGLAND.....BUT THEY DIDN'T PLAY WELL...............LUCK SAVED THEM.........A WICKET MISSED BY LYON AND THE LAST BALL OF LYON WAS A WICKET BUT LACK OF REVIEW OF AUSTRALIA THAT WAS DISMISSED  .......THE FUCKING UMPIRE
What an innings played by stokes.singlehandedly played.wow
"No celebration from Stokes after reaching 50 and 100. But look at his reaction after winning the match...
Awesome..... Amazing....
One of the best test innings..."
Ben stokes is Moses for England
I appreciate leach
Legend
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶what a innings
The king of England Ben Stokes
Ben Stokes ne na he apni half century celebrate na century celebrate ki par ushne sirf winning Wala moment celebrate Kiya. Koi India ka hota toh sirf apni sochta.
The bravemen won for England
"This match proovs
Success = LUCK + HARDWORK"
India learn from England how to play  and win in Australia.
Like wcc final
This is a fix match
Wow! incredible....what a game of cricket........superb
"that last frame, in slow motion, where Ben Stokes throws a punch in the air and crowd giving a standing ovation is the best moment for me........"
"I respect Ben Stokes winning
But I will say Steve Smith also should be seen in this best batting video of all time,"
One of the best test match ever
Eng is winning becauce lion is missing run out at last time
"Was out by nathan lion
Still well played stokes"
A test match better than 1000 t20 matches🔥
England well played but more than that Australia threw the match
What a performance...what a cricketer.... awesome... brilliant Benstok👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻...thumbs up and love from INDIA 🇮🇳
Lucky England team
This justifies that test cricket is best form of the game....
I can relate when pragyan ojha was not given out...laxman won the match for us...
"Aussies were just losted... they will always regret why they took that review, they knew it is a waste. now they will never make that mistake again."
Whenever there is no International cricket going on. I just replay this.
Greatest test match ever greatest inninigs ever

Match was won by Umpire.. 🤣🤣
2.8 k dislikes from kangaroos
Ben stokes you freak🤯🤩
"The greatest test inning I have ever seen

Ben Stokes, Take a bow!"
That's Why a Test Match is a real test of heroes....
What a match! What a player! What an innings! Absolutely amazing.
2 minutes silence for those people who missed this great match
ben stokes: balls of steel
Don't take anything away from this England innings or from Ben stoke's innings. Forget the runout miss or the LBW miss. There would have been multiple such chances in Australian innings as well which we might have missed out. This innings of Ben stokes deserves every bit of praise he that he recieves. Great innings great test match.
Great bating by Stokes single Handley won the match👍❤️🏏
The greatest test match i have witnessed so far
Great finisher ben stokes
Jack leach you are my hero
17:12 Has to be one of the greatest Frames in Sports broadcasting history.
I really like stocks
i think every decession should take by 3rd umpire. 1st umpires are fucking blind.
Ben Stokes meant to be bigger things. He has the luck in his Life.
"This match has everything thing .

Run out Miss by Lyon, unsuccessful attempt in review, never lose the hope until it finished."
bens stokes is national hero of england
Ben Stokes
Real test of cricket is test cricket.

The same Umpire who didn't gave Tim Paine out in today's match if you watch INDvAUS
Wat a moment and wat a player under pressure 🔥🔥🔥
You can't guarantee this much thrill even  in a t20 match. This Innings by Ben is the innings of the century for me.
Another name of Devil is BEN STOKES
Guts of an inning Ben well done

Alone warrior

Tbh England has got crazy fans just amazing
"Stokes intent was so powerful that everything went his way.(Failed DRS, missed run out and then Umpire's mistake).
Man !!universe really conspires to fulfill all your wishes, only the intent has to be extremely strong."
Stokes great all-rounder
Best Test Innings of the Decade
Goosebump innings
Don't forget the support of Jack Leach
Ashes never disappoints what a remarkable match and stokes stiff as always
Totally last wicked is fixed believe or not
"After Watching Complete Match, Virat Kohli be like: Ben-Stokes"

17:09 Stokesy nailed it ❤
Benjamin stokes the hero of england
9:48 incredible switch.....just loved it

The last slow motion where the crowd erupts is imo the best ever cricket frame.
My heart goes out to Nathan Lyon..
Unbelievable player 😇😇😇
I think Leach is 'Kachra' character from Lagaan movie😂😂
"upmire be like ""Ok ben u owe me one""."
"One of the best   inniigs cricket history from,one of the best all rounder in cricket history 🔥"

"Rohit

Tim paine totally hanged and ben stock rock well played stock
England getting carried by Leach
I won 47000$ because of incredible Ben stokes in betting on final day of this test match ..thanks for this BEN..

Best batsman ben stokes
Never seen such an innings 😍😍
Ben Stroke innings The greatest Innings
Started woth test ending t20
THANXX 2 THE UMPIRE 😂
I'm an Indian but i have watched this match like more than 15 times
Leach's best innings already
He was out. That's not fair.
Eapic innings stock
Jack Leach's single in this Test match vs Makhaya Ntini's single in that ODI. Which one does an Aussie wanna forget?
I think Leach is 'Kachra' character from Lagaan movie😂😂
Ye match Tim Paine ke karan Australia haara h. Bina Mtlab ke review gawaya h.
11:37 best
Super ben match day
Fortune favours the brave !
This is the best test match of decade 🔥🔥
💯💯💯
ben stokes is the lifetime  best strokesman suprb batsman
Just a shame that LBW of Stokes was not given. Stokes seems to find lucky ways to win (this match and the World Cup final). Come on England fans you know both were lucky wins.
The Crowds are lucky .
Best match i never ever hv seen..
Whenever ashes comes it will exciting.... crazy ashes fan from india
The bad day for Australia
Sensational batting 🔥🔥
And after that last ball appeal i think god doesn't want aus to win... Clear out
After ben stokes hitting six lyon just threw the ashes trophy in his hand.
It's all fault of the umpire and Nathan Lyon
greatest 🔥
This innings of Stokes would have given strokes to many people. Every time I feel clueless or depressed I just come here and watch this match.
"U need 100rs with one wicket left ...call Ben stokes. U need 100 rs in 50 ball call Ben stokes...u need someone to take a tremendous catch call Ben stokes u need someone to ball in the middle at high pressure call Ben stokes....
Ben stokes as of now world's best all-rounder ....top class in every department huge respect  🙏🙏🙏🙏"
I can watch this a 100 times in a day!
"I was biting nails in highlights, can imagine the real one"
One catch drop one run out missed one wrong dession umpire .. England won
This is the reason why English crowds are the best.
I like england
I like all matches in ashes
https://youtu.be/zRuBHg8Ekic my frd short film plz one time watch pannuga frds. Enkglku support panna yarmo ila frds ❤️🙏❤️
Hardik pandya should watch this
"A memorable test that i won't forget till  my last breath.  Ben Stokes is the Cricket in himself. His passion for cricket  ,   can't believe man  , how optimistic he is???   No man,  there is no all rounder left in this modern day cricket except  ""The Ben Stokes"".take a bow man."
purely Stoke's show....💫✨
Ben Stokes was clear LBW. Umpire gave it not out and Australia had no review left. If Umpire had give the correct decision Australia would have won by 1 run.
Fixing
This is the best cricketing video I seen after 2011 worldcup final
In a short span ..Stokes has produced some inceredible innings across all formats
Remember the name Benjamin Andrew Stokes :)
17:04 best moments for england 👍👍
Greatest 1 of all' TIME ❤️❤️
"Litterly aus lost because of their mistakes 
The catches dropped
Misfielding
Lbw out
Reviews lost
Run out chance
But england did their best
Like if u all agree?✨"
Watch it again and again and again but the surprise the tension is still there. The freak ben stokes 😕
2019will be remembered for Legend BEN Stokes
"What a wonderful work by stokes!  Whenever I watch this, I remember the speech said by Swami Vivekananda: Nothing is impossible."
And the winner is umpire
2nd best fourth innings ever after Kushal Pereira's the greatest of all times against south Africa in South Africa
"Hardik Pandya unhe dedo 
Stokes ko idher le aao😂"
it was a thrilling match
Never before match...what a great finish stokes.. great finish
I've never seen English crowd that much electric in there cricket history
"Hence proved 
Luck favours the hard work"
And the CWC 2019 hero STROKES
Stokes was already out
6th time
The commentators make it even more interesting
Stokes is a real legend
Stokes played a wonderful innings in this match
Is nobody gonna talk about the six at 11:36???
Ben stocks the real hero❤️
The best test match i have ever seen ❤️
testosterone level boosted after watching this
Best ever cricket match of all time 🙏🙏🙏🙏
17:11 that shot can give Goosebumps to stone also💓💓
One the best test match
Australia had bad luck. because they lost review
This is Lyon mistake
I would say england fans are the best
Innings of a lifetime🤩🙏
Watching it in Dec 2021... Without a doubt one of the greatest test match....
Unbelievable and love to watch it again and again. So this must be the record 10th wicket partnership to win a test match surely.  73 runs.
Who’s here to watch this gem of a test match day again and again !
Most matches England win only umpire Faversham  it is not win
He made history.....
17:00 That background makes my day!!!
england always get away with everything the umpire says. the cheating team england. how much do they pay the umpire?. even the world cup stokes got away even this match. england will never be a fair team untill they stop paying the umpire. wait if they stop paying the umpire then how will they win?
"Watching even in December 2020. 🤩 
Best Test Match!!!
I loved tests here onwards"
Luck plays very important role in such situations......
Goosebumps 🔥
Truly remarkable this man! Goosebumps all over!!
sirrr...
Nice
What a test match all credit to the worst empire who said notout to Stokes 🙏
"And they says that test cricket are boring ..... Lol 
This match was much more thrilling then worldcup final  just amazing ♥️"
"and test match is boring, mm..."
"As an indian, I have goosebumps  seeing that innings . :). Stokes you beauty"
One of the greatest test match... #Axomsketch
Rajasthan Royal ka sher
"No one actually appreciated jack leach, Joe denly and Joe Root in this match but if it they wouldn't have been there England would have lost a lot earlier"
That shot of Ben celebrating and crowd rises behind ..I want this frame on the wall of my  room for inspiration...Stokes is a legend ...Epic match !
If Smith would be there aus could have won easily
Superb ever in text match
I can watch this match 100 times Without getting bored
That was clear out. Umpire fixed
What a match!😍😍😍😍
"13:16 
Aussies : He was an imposter 🤦🏻🤦🏻

Jokes apart but this was one of the greatest Test match of all time . At the end of the day when you see the crowd its the victory for cricket."
Everytime Ben Stokes gives heart attack to his fan in the last over whether it's this match or icc 2019 WC final 🤦‍♂
One of the best match ...
all time greatest test ever played in history of cricket
13: 44 nathon lyon to his hands ye kya bawasir bana diye ho sala hath janjana jata h
He is amazing
"17:04 The greatest finishing moment...........................
I have ever seen...................
Remember the name: BEN STOKES"
That is the best innings of all time💥 .
I am from Bangladesh. And I always wanted that Bangladesh win But my second team is always been England 😃
I had a match on this day as well.in half way break england won the match
What a test match!!
what a crowd for test match
I don’t care if I’m Australian. Greatest cricket innings ever played by one man
"RIP his dad , Ged"
14:37 as plum as it gets.
Nothing is better than ashes.
Best matches of cricket of history
"Bucket list: Go to England to watch       ashes 
Simply highest standard of test cricket"
I think Luck always support England Team.
"As an Aussie supporter, just one of them innings where I don't think we necessarily bowed bad, Stokes was simply too good.."
"The way the crowd erupts when Stokes “cut away, cut away for four!” gives me goosebumps. 

Every. Single. Time."
"The oceanic desk energetically shelter because dress anteriorly desert apropos a ripe sunshine. wacky, smiling slice"
Great example of match fixing lol
this match was fixed as u can see in last over.
Leaving this comment just to ensure I was alive to witness this run chase ❤️
did someone said in hindi 'pakad' at 6.34🤣🤣😂😂😂
Australia has reviews ansolutely Australia win
Last 20-25 runs are felt like sharp poisonous arrows to the chest for Australia.
17.09 Fucking Goosebumps 😍🔥❤️ This is Real cricket ❤️
There's a lot of similarity between me and England....we hardly win......winners are on the left.....losers are on the right...that's the reality
The real star of cricket
As an Indian I have no shame in saying that stokes is best all rounder in the world. Pandya is not even close.
Jack leach be like : wtf who am i in this contest😴
Stokes: probably the luckiest man ever
God was watching this test match and he wanted BEN to win.
I'm never seen this type of cricket. This is incredible & amazing test match . Stroke❤❤❤
Greatest test inning by stokes
Best format of cricket is....Test cricket 💪💪💪❤️❤️❤️😍😍
Watching after rj ronac chanel 😂😂😂

Ben stokes!!!!!   😂😂😂😂"
This is a fucking movie !
joey wilson becoming new dharmasena
wasted review
at last he was playing t20 cricket and aussies fielding all players on rope
"tim paine should not be captain, he has not played any innings for aussies
by the way i am indian"
When stokes hit the ball at 17:00 I literally got goosebumps 😀😀
still speechless to this day
Wrong umpiring changed the results of ashes....oh god
"ടെസ്റ്റ് ക്രിക്കറ്റിന്റെ കാലം കഴിഞ്ഞു എന്ന് പറഞ്ഞവരുടെ അണ്ണാക്കിൽ അടിച്ച്കൊടുത്ത മാച്ച്
Well done big ben.❤️"
All time storks innings  super 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Don't forget leach faced 16 dot balls.
This is why  nothing will ever beat Test cricket.
"England lucky then, England lucky now"
Ben stokes
I've watched this match... Read about this match... But it still give me goosebumps...
"This is not the best test cricket of all time , this is the worst dicision ever made by the umpire."
"U need goosebumps ???

The most dramatic sensational and greatest match ever ever n ever in cricket history👍
"What a batting yaar... Amazing, fabulous"
"This Type Of History achievable only in English 🤭
# WC19BCFINAL"

13:36 the crowd is silent as they hold their breath
"https://youtu.be/T8I33XsL8Iw
India Vs Australia 2nd odi match highlights 2020

One of the best test innings ever. What an Year for Ben Stokes
"This match was the best even relative to best t 20 match ♥️..ben stokes miracle after long time in world cricket after sachin,lara,warne."
Why nobody is talking about leach surviving those 17 balls..
Even umpire don't want Ben Stokes out
Repeatly seeing this match
"Strokes and lyon looks like WWE wrestlers @ the moment of missing
run out.."
I think Jack Leach is the best test player .scoring 1(75) is best knock ever 😙
Who love test cricket more than ODI or t20
@17:05 Ben stokes deserved that ❤
Best all rounders in this time Sir jadeja and sjr stocks 😊😊🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
You gotta feel for butler
"What a winter warmer, enjoyed watching this again during these darker days"
The atmosphere there will never be matched again
15:04 The greatest one of all time.
I don’t have any doubt in my mind that this is the greatest test innings ever.
England’s best player is a New Zealander
Stokes is better than Maxwell
Match was Fixed See the last umpire
This was the best one I have ever seen.......
England has definately kept teat cricket alive ...with their passion and dedication...
This 16 min. Video can give any cricket fan a mini heartattack..
"well, some people are born just to remind the world that nothing is impossible...Ben Stokes is a legend"
All credit to leach
Criketi mharhthi
The greatest test match
Match fixing run out mis lbw mis catch mis
What a player ben stokes
That lbw.In real time Stokes moving his leg quickly to leg saved him.You can't blame the umpire
Well.. Lady Luck is paying out for what happened to stokes in the T20 Final (Carlos Braithwait).
One of the most wonderful innings in world cricket history and greatest victory of victory🔥🔥🔥stokes u legend man 🙏🙏🙏 ❤️❤️...u beauty 😍😍
"This player has the temperament of God...
#Testmatchesaretherealdeal..."
"This is Cricket
This is sport
This is the reason I love Cricket
My goodness ❤❤❤
Cricket is Emotion"
IMO this is by far the second greatest test innings after the KJP's 153 as ben Stokes and england had so many chances where as kusal never gave a chance to the proteas!!
Stoke is a master
Ben stocks with his luck in this test match n also in world cup final
17:06 The best scene u will ever see
"Who said test cricket is boring.Its even more interesting and nail biting than the t20s
Who all agree
👇"
Aus trying hard to Make england win
One of the greatest days in the history of test cricket.
Left handed batsman always special.. like Ben stokes and kusal perera
"With this match, it is still proved that Benjamin Andrew Stokes is one of the greatest players of all time."
"11 :44 oo Ben what are you doing to this cricket match 😅😅
12:00 no way man
14:07 too much for everybody"
And some people compared Hardik Pandya to Ben Stokes😂😂😂😂
"If stokes is not a part of eng team and he play for nz 
Eng will never won wc and ashes 
If u aggre like👍"
Best test ever
This is not like kohli who overshow herself in making 100
Ashes play a major role in keeping the test cricket alive... a mind blowing rivalry 😍 🔥
Jack leach💥💥
"So after that match Aussies knew the value of ""REVIEW"".A one bad decision & u'll loss the game."
"6:33
did someone say ""pakkad"" 😂🤣"
"Stokes ne 100 marne k baad bhi celebrate nahi kiya ...
Aur apna jadeja WC semi final me 50   k baad talwaar bazi karra tha😑"
NATHAN LYON. BEST FUMBLE IN CRICKET  HISTORY.
"An Umpire is a cricketer, too"
Test cricket at its best
Mitchell starc would have make difference for tailender like Jack leach
"Best Test innings of all time, well played BEN STOKES"
"The moment Mark Nicholas said: Here we go then, the scores are level! And Stokes cuts that ball away.

Just a beautiful moment of cricket. Even Indians would agree(like me)."
Man that Lyon lbw Lyon run out cost them match
Almost as good as Perera and Lara's respective 153s! Incredible!!
15:17
Do you know when they lost the match when they took review to cummins bowl to leach bcoz if the review still they have they can won by 1 run because lyon lbw was an out man serious
The real MVP here is Leach.
Then Flintoff and Now Stokes
"Don't give up hope too early,for that Australia decision to take review knowing that it's down leg,and missing the opportunity to ben"
😂 over rated match it seems like ash comes once in 4years like world cup 😂
H
Stokes made 100
Goosebumps....
"Joel Wilson, dear me....."
the best test match of cricket history
15:06 the greatest Single of All Time
Inning of a daydreamer
Watching this again and again Man ... Damn Goosebumps💪🏻
"England most lucky team of the decade.
World cup final and ashes final day 
Witnesses their luck"
Stokes this century =15 century of Kohli....It is very hard to accept this but it is true....
"This is the cricket I signed up for, not the ipl chuthiya with betting game promos. THIS is the cricket that remains."
Luck is with England
Foolish captaincy by Tim Paine. Hand over the captaincy back to Smith. He is more more Better than him
These innings comes once in a decade
Ben stokes remember the name ❤️
From headingley in 1981 to headingley in 2019
Watch this video whenever you are having a bad day.
Mind blowing
Great wrk great player great great
Great player what a match
Less incredible more luck. Looks like luck is in his favour since WC final. Australia literally gifted it to england.
Greatest chase ever in the history of  test cricket
"""It's too much for everybody."""
That may be the best single in test cricket.. In one day international i think ntini's single against australia in their legendary chase of 434 must be the best..
nathan lyon  dropped the ashes - gowlden chaance.  2019 belongs to Ben Stokes ..then ...Covid ....
Big mistake by umpire it was clearly a lbw
"Crowed of the ausis and England have very interesting, even their matches specially the (Ashes) have been very fascinate"
"England have found a marvles cricketer, he's the hero for Englishmens, unbleaveable knock. bad luck for the ausis to miss the dramatic and closed chances"
The greatest test inning ever
"Stokes played incredibly but
That run out chance
Lbw decision
I think you need some good luck as chasing such a big score single handed is not enough."
Sheer fearless cricket
Every Leach defense was applauded
i watched this nearly 100 times
Reason why he is the best all-rounder in the world
Ben Stokes: True Champion 🔥❤️
Wow Ben stokes is my favourite player it is a world record yes
In this match and wc 2019 final eng won because of Ben stokes in both matches luck plays a major role 😂😂😂😂  this match lbw of stokes and in wc final over throw gone for four. But any way Ben stokes is a warrior he faught like a warrior in both situations.
"If u were watched SA vs AUS 438 One day & this match, then u r legend.🙏🙏"
Cricket balls of steel!
"Stokes the cheater
In 2019 wc: unknowingly throwing the ball to boundary
Ashes:did match fixing(the last one was out)
.

Don't be angry on me..it's a joke.
Stokes is a superb player and a England hero"
"ENGLAND CRICKET BOARD- We are England Cricket!
BEN STOKES- NO! You are ""England"" and I am ""CRICKET""
WHAT A PLAYER!!"
13:43 that attitude 🔥🔥🔥
Ben stokes is brave.... But fortunate as well
I'm 16 . The greatest ever test match or prolly the greatest ever match I've seen live . Damn. What level of cricket.!
@16:59 ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER SLOW MOTION REPLIES IN CRICKET.
"He's not ben stokes
He's Ben 10"
The 1 run that counted. Jack Leach the Hero.👏👏
Ben stokes🔥🔥🔥
Who are here after watching “The Test” on prime?
In last it was not looking like test match
Best
"The english at any other cricket game when their team takes a wicket or hits a boundary: **formal clapping**
The english at the ashes when their team takes a wicket or scores 4/6: **intense warcries**"
*STOKES*  IS SUPER HUMAN 🔥
One off the greatest match fixing plays by Nathan Lyon off all time
Ben stokes what player he is
Unforgettable ennings...🏏👌👌👌
how someone can unlike the heroics of ben stokes.... u kidding me 2.5k dislikers
2019  was the luckiest year for England cricket
Best allrounder of the game...some are over rated
Cricket fans loved t20 and odi but real cricket fans enjoyed test match
Ben stokes is the hero♥️✨
Real cricket is Test Match cricket but this test is test of decade i think 2010 to 2020
"Legends say ben stokes is not human is is ultra human the perfect example of 3D cricketer (batting, bowling, fielding) thats why virat kohli loves the name ben stokes so much(only legends can understand this)."
https://youtu.be/YFahftvjS0A
"16:44 Winning hit, and then a punch"
2.8 million views is very less for a master class in the cricket history.
Did anyone notice..5:20....Buttler is not run out..Lyon missed the ball....
"I saw the lance klusener, michael Bevan, misbah ul haq, MS Dhobi etc.. Etc.. In one name that is Ben stokes. In this test match especially."
It was like the 2nd innings of a T20 match not like a test match.
so tense
One of the greatest test matcher ever seen
Lifetime innings from benjamin stokes🧐
Be it the wc 2020 finals or this match England always needs luck and umpires to win a match😏
Only if Tim Paine knew when to use reviews
Cricket in England is so much better than anywhere in the world
The greatest
❤️❤️❤️
This is probably the most entertaining test match ever in the history of cricket
16:59 What a view ! 😍😍
"Ben stokes played important role for England. BEN STOKES IS  THE BRILLIANT ALLROUNDER IN THE WORLD. HE DO BRILLIANT FIELDING,BATTING,BOWLING"
Now u Will understand value of croud  after covid19.cricket is nothing without croud
Test cricket at its best.
It got me goosebumps!
I love very much BEN STOKES
Australia were beaten by the umpire
And some idiots compare him with hardik pandya. RIP idiot
Ben Stokes be shouting his own name after hitting that Boundary 🤣W🤣.
"12:54 **""keep your cool ben, you are on the brink of greatness, if you're not already there""**"
Aur ek hmaare hardik pandya jee hai saala bsdk
I have watched  this so many times the crowd and Majestic Ben Stokes
Super Star Stokes💥 from India🇮🇳
Someone told me that Shivam dube is better than Stokes 😂😂
I have watched it nearly about 100 times
"Who agrees this is the best test innings of the century
👇"
This match is a fine example to show why the toughest form of cricket is the most interesting form !
17:06 what a sight
Amazing crowd absolutely electric!!!
Ben Stokes The best test innings ever!!!!!! Awesome
One of the greatest performance by ben stokes... 😈😈
"This proof luck always favours the brave...
What a match this was!!!"
Imagine if umpire gives out🙄🙄
What a great luck England has both in Ashes and World Cup
"Kusal perera and ben stokes  
Unbelievable two ining
After 20 years incricket"
"There's nothing Mr. Incredible ""Ben Stokes"" can't do. There was 79 to win at one point of time, with Jack Leech scoring only 1 of those runs. He has made the impossible possible. Hats off to the world's best all rounder"
What a Bats Man a Ben Stokes Simple one of the Greatest in My Capacity
Mast
Ben
stoker played really well but because of the umpire australia lost hard luck australia
Joe wilson sacrifice his job to win england this match. pray for him
I am sure that if it was indian team in place of England then it would be most viewed indian video with over 1 billion views as of now.
That's why he is in our team!! Rajasthan royals
Aur Iska Compare.  Wo IPL Ka Dalla Pandya Se Kr Rhe🤣🤣🤣
For me rhe winners are Australia
This match give me goosebumps same like Lagan movie last over
Full match replay pls
Ppl who is thinking test matches are very bore they do watch this full innings.. the nail bitting game ever comaring to lot of T20 and one day matches.. strokes one man army🔥🔥
Ben stokes Me Fvrt player in the match❤🥳🥳
Behen Stokes🤭🤪
"14.30...Lyon: how is that
14.36...Umpire: its out ...but i am not give u its out becoz benjamin stroke put his soul on the line for this match)
Finally god always help him to finish..
What a test match 
Give one like for ben👍👇"
It was meant to be.... Imagine the adrenaline gushing through Stokes
I liked this match but only thing that I don't liked is that the empire took the wrong decision in the last that's why England or elese Australia would have won that match
had australia not used review against leach which they knew he was not out they could have sealed ashes
Everytime i watch this ennings it's remind me of the great Brian Lara & the West Indies wall as in Shivnerine Chanderpaul. Leach deserve a lot more praise than you all give him. We all knew Ben Stokes is the best on his day bat or ball. Ben was asleep until that ball crash into the back of his helmet. One of the greatest ennings ever in test cricket though.
I am from India but england is my favorite team ❤️❤️❤️
The legend BEN STOKES
Ben stokes is one man army
This is what I don't like about umpires. They should give out when the call is close. Batsmen would take DRS if they think it's not out. Specially when a team has lost DRS should be favored by umpire. Coz the opponent can take Drs if they think it's not good decision
That was definitely a fantastic performance but that one wrong decision from the umpire in the end made me quite pissed off
"LUCK!!! was definitely on England's side
but anyways great test match👌"
Excellent Strokes by Stokes.
17:00
Best test inning so far💟
"""The greatest one of all time"""
Who noticed it after winning this match Ben stroke shouted Behen stroke 🤣🤣
"Watching this at 1:20am in locked down England just to bring back the feeling. I was there! We were just out of shot on the right at 17:00. I don't think I'll ever be lucky enough to witness something like this in my life. If I close my eyes, I can still see Cummins running in; I can still see Stokes shaping up to smash it through extra cover; I can still hear the crunch of willow on leather and the tiny moment of dead silence before the whole place around me exploded with noise and the feeling of utter elation as strangers around me embraced. As long as I live, I will never forget that moment. My children and grandchildren will hear about it from me and so will anyone else who cares to ask. It's these moments you hold on to that last a lifetime, that give you a story to tell, that make you proud you've witnessed history.
Bloody marvellous."
Its all about Ben stokes✌🏻💪
👌👌👌
I watched this highlights atleast 20-30 times

Every time England get luck because of bad calls from Umpires
"Umpire fault and england win,s and the same thing happened in  world cup what cheater,s they are."
As long as Ashes is played and we have matches like this and super men like Stokesy.....Test cricket is alive and kicking

3.The Umpire

And the heroes:
1.Jack Leach
2.Ben Stokes"
🔥🔥🔥BEN STOKES🔥🔥🔥
leach is the real hero bcz he is keep the wicket for the  stokes strikes 🔥🔥
"Allan bordee is correct about tim paine, he should be removed from australia's captaincy otherwise the  australian cricket will be doomed."
What stroke yar isae accha test match dekhne ko nai melega
Is it just me or do women commentators sound slightly more masculine during the men's matches??
And People think this happened in reality😋
17:04 this is gold. One moment to remember for centuries.🔥🔥
Ben stoks best finisher
Umpire was a cheater
"A dropped catch, a missed runout and a wrong umpire decision...the holy trinity of an incredible test match"
Stokes played stupid shorts in last moments
Water match
"Who's watching here in October and November.
✋ ✋ ✋ ✋ ✋"
It feels good when tests have such huge crowds... They destroy so many myths
"Son : dad t20s have huge crowds and test is boring
Dad : u r grounded"
That's why test is my favourite
Seeing nth time
The best finisher ever
Tell me something thriller then this! I will wait lifetime.
Matches like this makes me love this game even more.
"Let's slap them who say's test match is dull match





By hitting the like button"
I m thinking about the feeling of crowd
Spare a thought for poor Lyon!
I Just Love  BEN STOKES
one of the best thrilling test match i ever seen
I'm glad this was in front of packed crowd.. it would've been awful if this was the scene today and we heard recorded crowd noise
That's the beauty of test cricket and ashes is one of the reason test cricket is still alive .
Very nice
could never get bored of watching this - truly inspiring
STOKED 💕❤️
Bairstows 36 overlooked here - changed the whole momentum of the game and gave Stokes a bit of belief
Kismat
England always win cheaply just like the World Cup final
Best ever
"Ben, you beauty!!!!"
Biggest run of decades is WC FINAL  and this leach run
Clapsss for Bloody stokes he has luck💞😍
Stand aside Sir Ian Botham and Andrew Flintoff.
It was best test cricket match ever!
The best I have ever seen.... God
Man of the Match truely Leach 😎😎😎
"His heroics in this match will probably up right there at the top of greatest tests match innings ever played.... We focus too much on technique, beauty of shots, number centuries scored etc.... Nothing of that mattered when a batsman cannot win a game.... And here is, a guy who is an bowling alrounder, doing impossible with bat. Wickets crumbled around him & he kept on going. A situation where spectators had their hairs on their hand. But he blasted on... Even shielding the last partner. It's a wonderful match going right down to wire & its an incredible manifestation of bravery & character of lion hearted cricketer...."
The greatest match innings by an englishman. Probably the greatest win against australia after the laxman miracle at eden gardens. Ben stokes u beauty
"I love this so much. I watched it with no knowledge of how the game is played and it was still amazing. ""we've done so much for the game of cricket today."" I now watch cricket as often as possible. Such a great competition."
So love watching this...thousands of people together watching sublime brilliance in the summer sun. We had no idea of the storm approaching.
Keep coming back to this... It's soo fun to watch Australia get rekt😁
"This is absolutely luck 
I mean 1 run-out and 1 lbw😭
Aus real winner"
Sri lanka
I cried after Lyon's fumble.
"What is the most terrifying cinematic moment?
Others:All jump scares from conjuring
Australians: Ben Stokes not celebrating his 💯"
Ben Stokes has to be one of the hardest working cricketers around. Farming the strike and hit the ball all around the ground. Absolutely superb innings.

All time best all-rounder in the history of cricket

Lyon-o had him plumb!
i hope 2020 is like englands innings.
Drop catch...run out chance ...and a waisted review earlier ...luck is on England's side and stokes a legend in the making...wow what an inning of lifetime
An unforgettable match. Especially for the aussies.
Best match and wat a player
Ipl is on line for RR..They need stokes
Ben Stokes is a precious player that shines for england in the dark night
Here main effort is 9 th batsmen
Just amazing. Pure joy.
The dragon Stokes
whenever I'm feeling depressed or broken I just see this video.
"Man of the moment,Man of the match & one in a million Ben Stokes...Lots of appreciation from Pakistan 🇵🇰"
16:37 lol
"It's amazing that two Countries play for the Ashes , one Country was created by the other Country I.E. England.  Yet they are fighting for the Ashes most Important Trophy of all time ."
I don’t have any doubt in my mind that this is the greatest test innings ever.
Ben stokes remember the name
still remember being at reading festival and loads of people went off to watch an act and me and a few of my mates stayed in the tent to watch this magnificent innings
My player 💪💪💪
why umpires are so partial or favours England all times
"when someone from any other teaams would done what England done to other teams they would be a world war-3 but not for England 

probably they are winning because cricket was born there lol"
how to win a match just act like stokes
hey that is clear out maybe umpire favours all time to England all they won any cup it is only because of umpires
Umpire ki maa ka bhosda😠
"The battle for best in the world is among 
Virat Kohli Ben Stokes and Steve Smith"
He was out lBW . Ben stokes
"You fuckin losers,won the world cup because of umpire error ,kiwis deserved it.
Won the ashes because of umpiring error
The Aussies deserved it
That's why I was not shocked when you dumbfucks lost against ireland"
"England, Ben stokes and vampire"
Take a bow Ben Stokes
"Highlights of the match
1) Stokes fabulous batting
2) Jack Leach- one run of his life
3) Paine- Wasted review
4) Lyon missed run out chance"
"After 30 years 
Interviewer: What was your best inning of your life? 
Jack Leach: That 1 run against Australia during an Ashes match. 
Kids of that generation: 😳😳😳"
Truly outstanding innings by Stokes
"Watched this day match for more than 10times. Never dropped goosebumps!

 Drop by Harris, Worst Review by Paine, Run out miss by Lyon, Vision Fade for umpire! The day was completely belonged to Ben Stokes & England! Best even goosebumps filled Red Ball cricket! The best! Test cricket is/was/will always at it's best! 
""ASHES"""
Ben Stokes timed his innings to help us through the lock downs
If that was England vs India the entire comments section would be filled with Indians calling England and the umpire 'cheats'..
It wasn’t just stokes it was all the players that survived with him
"Best test match innings - Ben Stokes
Best ODI World Cup Finals - Ben Stokes"
3:15  took my headphones off to checkout....!
Brilliant! How did he do it?
Even commentary was on top
I keep coming back here again and again..just to see the GOAT test innings..and also a LEGEND..
This video is great of final day highlights of Ben Stokes at the Ashes. Click here to know more- https://www.cricketship.com/jack-leach-from-ben-stokes-sidekick-to-a-summer-without-a-game/
Batter is not out seen in video
Best innings of cricket.ben stokes.brave men.
"the master of masters, greatest ever left handed batsmen and most valuable player .  I present you Sir Jack Leach."
"As incredible as that innings was, 359 really shouldn’t have been that dramatic from 240–4"
"*It was the day of Ben Andrew Stokes. If Tim Paine didn't waste that review, if Nathan Lyon didn't missed that run out. & if umpires didn't lost his eye vision then Ben Stokes could never be the ""Test Player Of The Year"" it's all written in his destiny. It's alll planned for stokes by god*"
Umpire's last decision about Ben was responsible for England victory...it's all destiny
"Absolutely nail bitting match.
And very poor level of umpiring.
If u r playing international cricket u didn't expect this poor level of umpiring and this kind of fielding done by australia.😡😡😡"
Wow absolutely you beauty stuck
Wata match mind blowing
Leach and stock both 👌👌👌
"Best cricket ever 
Best Chase ever
Best finish ever
Stock u beauty love you Umaah"
Ben stokes is too lucky
still seeing this quarantine
This is an another eden garden test match for aussies...
who plays scoops and reverse shots in these kind of pressure situation. he surely has the heart of steel......
"The drama, the crowd, the commentary, epic last wicket partnership, Ben epic inning, leach greatest single of all time- Has been the quality of highest level."
It will be the greatest win ever
THE greatest test innings of all time. What a game it was.
Wat an incredible innings by ben stokes
Best match I have ever seen😱 Ben stokes Best Allrounder in the world💖💪
Stokes ... A history maker
14:15 yes Mike ...yes
"Aussie should have won this several times... But that is the greatest test innings a batsman could, and has, ever played in the context of the final innings of a test. Black Caps fan but credit where it is due!"
so THAT's what thriving under pressure looks like...
Unforgettable moments for Ben Stokes.. Lucky man !
Stokes
when Tim Paine is your captain . you will lose the ashes ! simple !
"Can a Sensefull Dislike This Match?? 
The Day Has been Written On The Page of History.
Remember The Name
 *Ben Stocks* ❤❤❤"
Jack Leach was the hero just saying
Ben stokes remember the name
@00.50...Too early to conclude decessively. ..

One of the Best test match of all time.
"I missed beats while watching these highlights ,GOD knows about those who watched Live🙄"
Think that empire was totally Biased against eng
"It was too much at the end, pressure does many things to people"
Best Match I have ever seen in test cricket
Bit late on the effort wasnt it? England got smashed in the ASHES
Memoreble match of cricket history
Why ecb have changed the commentary of the match the other one is more exciting
England version of lagaan 😁😁
16.50 emotions
I think dislikes from Australia 😂🤣😅
"What an incredible innings! I feel as nervous and excited as I did when I watched it live on TV! One of the most astonishing fight backs in sport. Take a bow, Ben Stokes!"
Pressure pressure pressure. What a man Ben!!!
Everytime I need motivation I don't know why I chose this masterpiece ❤️
"Pity the vast majority of people in England can't watch the cricket, why am I paying for a licence, BBC rubbish"
Let's be honest you searched for this
"What a match, what a day. ❤️"
Pat Cummings blind 😂😂 review fucked up everything for the Aussies
The greatest match of modern era in tests for sure Ben stokes u beauty ❤️👍
What a fantastic player.1 man army.
"Should learn each and every country how to fix the match by seeing this... Shameful, shameless, useless👎..."
Joe Wilson has got to be the man of the match

What a match what a serviver
The English Kohli...what a player.
As an Australian its quite heart breaking to see our team losses in such a close match.  But no doubt  ben inning was really amazing.
Best test match of history of human man kind
ഒരു രക്ഷയും ഇല്ല സ്റ്റോക്സ്
Its one of d best from Stokes...wat an inning...keep going...
"The greatest test match i have ever seen
  Ben stokes u r my favorite"
Wonderful scene in the end
That foolish review took the match from Australia
Leach's greatest 1 run of all time ....
"Tim Paine unnecessarily used his last review, Nathan Lyon in tension to miss run out and the main advantage is Umpire Lost his Eye vision its a clean out lol..All these are advantages to won England.. Anyways Ben stokes what an innings he was played"
Oh Ben what are you doing it's a cricket match!
"This is only can do ben stokes at last and no one

Example: world cup final 2019 eng vs nz
Love from india."
One of the greatest innings in test history. Only Ben Strokes can do such heroics.
Stokes Warrior
🇳🇿🇳🇿🇬🇧The autmosphere for that match in the headingly stadium was like any other.....🇬🇧🇳🇿🇳🇿
14:00 sums up the match... there but not there
I never see test match like this ..He will be better finisher than MS Dhoni ..One Worldcup made possible by  Benjamin ...many more will come soon
Fortune favors the braves.
"Umpire should have given the lbw out. Because England still had 1 review left. If in case umpire's decision was wrong, England could have taken the review and save themselves."
Australian dropped cathes and dropped catches got converted into boundaries. nathan missed run out. Tim intentionally took wrong review. WHAT THE HELL IT IS . IT LOOKED FIXED
"14:36 - No matter how many times I see this, I'm sure in my mind. The umpire didn't make a ""brave"" decision. He just got carried away by the moment."
17:05 greatest ever
Absolute fantastic match ..
"Real cricket English cricket 
The backbone of test cricket 
Reason for test cricket is standing"
Why Indian comments are everywhere. I think we Indians love cricket doesn't matter who is playing. Even i have stopped so many to time to watch gully cricket.😂😂
My hats off to Leach.
Luck favors the brave. Well played Ben Stokes
"i cant decide which innings os stokes was better 
the wc19f inal or this test
and which match was the match of the history of the game 
the final of wc19 or this test
someone  pls help
otherwise stokes you pls help"
You never know when you will need a review. The best example for anyone in future on how costly can a bad and reckless decision be.
Probably the best rollercoaster ride ever felt anyone in a test much...!!! even now also get goosebumps....!!!
England won this match and Australia won the series.
How many aust drop catch and last ball run out miss show match was fixed
Fixed match by betfair365
Watt match... I have seen ever monster innings by Ben.... One man army..... Just like a kolkatta test the wall and vvs
Ben stokes is superstar of cricket
Can someone explain why Buttler was given out... bowler did not have the ball...!!!
England win matches always bcuz of luck
Watching him reminds me of what Yuvraj Singh was for India in ODI. And esp the T20 wcup match against Aus.
Who is here after England winning two t20s against Australia
"Once upon a time
Benstock was reason of loss the title trophy of ICC t20
This called day and nigh changes"

"People who succeed have momentum. The more they succeed, the more they want to succeed, and the more they find a way to succeed. Similarly, when someone is failing, the tendency is to get on a downward spiral that can even become a self-fulfilling prophecy.""

Ben stokes has  shown brilliant determination in against Wordcup 2019 and in this test match to overcome  the 4 sixes rcvd by breathwhite in T 20 Worldcup final
I will never forget this inning watching live and repeated like 1000 times. What a game this was.
"Nathan lyon has retired...i hope

Idiot"
Historic. Test. Match. Ever.
Ashes. warofthecricket. Ever.
Hats of to leach for surving with  ben stokes and Amazing shots played by him pleasure to watch
waiting to see #Smith back to leads Aussies as Captain...🔥🔥🔥
High level fixing could be learn from these aussie.....
"One of the greatest all round, remember the name ben stokes 🔥"
Umpire won the match
Dream
"This innings is overrated
Kusal perera's 153 is way better"
"That's fixing of some high quality right there,  multiple catches on the boundary just let go by the aussies, easy run out chance just missed,  umpire not giving out even though he was hit right on the leg right in front of the wickets,  coincidences?  One too many I'd say."
If any ask about complete package of cricket then say him England and Australia specially when they are in Ashes...wooow.. other teams are show sha only
Stokes ...Eng s charm and a lucky one!!
"Incredible. Absolutely incredible. How did he do it?? How?

I'm talking about Joe Denly's 50 of course"
too much luck and equally too much power and will from stokes

Probably the greatest test match knock ever!
why that tiny bit of luck is important again proves with ben stokes... that lbw not given by umpire🤷‍♂️
"13:36 that six, that commentery, that crowd's reaction, that Stokes face. Wow. Whataa an amazing cricketing moment. Surely one of the best of all time."
"In my time, I thought Kohli and AB de are the greatest cricketers I have ever seen but this man is no behind them. Ben Stokes is surely the most valuable and important player in World cricket right now. Since the day he was hit for 4 big hits by Carlos Braithwait he took a different flight. He is flying since then. He has done wonders for English cricket and World cricket as well. He has achieved so much on the field. His attitude of never giving up is something that has transformed him from bottom to peak. Have seen many unbelievable things Stokes does like that one handed catch during World Cup 2019. This amazing match winning performances, that wicket of Kohli at key time when India needed just 50 runs, those slip catches, that World cup final performances and who can forget his Fielding efforts, he was bowling, Batman played a drive to Long off he ran and stopped the ball from being the boundary. Such things can't be done by normal cricketer, he is surely a super cricketer. Love 💗 🇵🇰🇵🇰"
It all started with that wonderful catch in the world cup.
This match was not good for cardiac patients 🙄
2019 world cup final and this test match umpire is hero for England. In world cup umpire dharmasena giving 6 runs and this match a clean lbw not given . But no reviews for Aussies. In Ashes alway like Support   for England only for all ashes series. But this match and world Cup final. Umpire played well.
England walo ka luck achaa tha 2019 me out hoke bhi not out awa bhai😂😂😂
"Best ever knock for ben Stokes in his life.
Best ever win for England."
Greatest cricketer
I'll never get tired of watching this even after 50 years. Thank you England & Australia for keeping test matches alive.
Ben real hero of the cricket 🏏
I'm so glad a poor umpiring decision cost the cheating aussies.
15:24 I missed this crowd so much in qurentine
It is luck by chance like World Cup
Moral of the story - Don't waste your review..
Strokes played really well but at 245 / 4 it was anyways England's game to loose...thankfully they didn't.
Who watched this live?
Luckiest England
"Haha, this is called fixing at the highest level...."
2.1k Aussies have watched this clip too great
why the hell Paine reviewed that...just foolish captaincy at the end..
Luck with English players
wow..wt.match
"Man of the Match must had been a difficult decision. Stokes, Leach, Lyon, Paine or the Umpire? 😂"
Rather than the benstokes innings ....two people helped england to win the match ...one is Lyon and other is tim paine ..Lyon with missed runout ...other hand tim paine with worst ever review
Aus must have died of terror when strokes didn't celebrate his 💯!!!!
Incredible batting! I guess I have watched this clip at least 5-6times and found every time edge if the seat performance!
"I keep coming back here once in a while... 
Done for today see you again in a while 
Like if you are jawstruck too 😍😉"
"With the World Cup and this test england were very lucky bc of one fielding and umpiring Error .
World Cup :
Fielding : boult catches this ball and touches the boundary 
Umpiring : dhamarsena gave it 6 runs when it was meant to be 5 of stokes bat 

Ashes : fielding : Lyon fumbles
Umpiring: Joel Wilson gave the appeal not out when it was actually out"
My hero is sachi saurav yuraj kumble nd lastly stokes..but not kholi at all
14:35 motherfucker umpire 😡😡
Mam of the match goes Nathan Lyon & the on field umpire. UNLUCKY AUSTRALIA!!!
I think Paine will regret about that wrong review for the entirety of his career.Man the roar of the fans after the winning run is greater than when they won the WC
Worst review by aus 🙄🙄🙄
"Real thing Australia Won by 2 runs well played🥴🧐 Stokes' Lbw b Lyon👏👏

Well played Stokes👏👏👏"
I think this was the best inning ever.
"I'm big heater of England team while they play in home..
But this inning was incredible 😯👍🏻"
"If you are a fan of the mysterious game of cricket, Generating after generating have to wait to see a match like this."
Ahhh back when we had crowds at sporting events.  I'll never take these experiences for granted again
BBC commentators got nothing on Nasser and Co I’m afraid
"2019 wc Ben stokes - wrong decision by umpires
Ashes Ben stokes- wrong decision by umpires"
One of the greatest innings ever.
Everything is white
That was one hell of an Innings
"I can't explain This moment
Live Dekhne Ka aLag pressure tha
Love Cricket From Depth of my hearT"
Match fixing
"Man of the match 
Umpire"
Similar version of England's world cup winning moment
All credit goes to umpire again 😂14:56
"Aus:   : (
Eng:  mwahahahaahhaaahahaha......
....................mwahahahahah.............................mwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah....
.................haha!"
Bad luck for Aussies
That was the performance of the decade. Goosebumps.
Yes england is 2019 best team
I think umpair was a hero of  this match why Lyon bowl's to Stokes'he missed the sweep then loud should for lbw but eusy out umpair don't giving the out by stokes this umpair was a men hero of this match Australia should win this match easyley  but umpair bad dicetion cost them
"Lyon is the culprit and I don't believe tha,  always Stokes have that ""LUCK""..."
"Therefore never ever we should loose hope,we have to fight as hard as it's need to win...."
"The luck is in with Ben Stokes in 2019, wheather it is Ashes or the overthrow from Guptill goes for 4 in World Cup final"
"That review lost, run-out miss...
Poor mistakes in a high-pressure situation😶"
Love you 3000
"Turning point of the match was tim paine wasted the review in pat Cummins over,the ball clearly pitched outside the line and the ball goes to down the leg if they nok the review in Cummins over then they definitely ask for the review in Lyon's over.Unfortunately umpire not given LBW in that over."
Nathan Lyon Lol😂😂
"What a finish 
 Just feel the heat 
  Mind blowing"
"Undoubtedly this is one of the greatest innings but not the greatest. Kusal Perera's innings against South Africa in Durban - South Africa will always be on top. 2nd innings with a target of 304, away conditions and winning it for SL is simply incredible!!!

Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22aocVwLuTw"
"Although I'm Indian. I watched this match live till 3 am.

Congratulations Eng for WC and this match win. Both won truly on luck (5 runs in overthrows in wc and runout miss by nathon lyon in the last over this in match) .  It won't happen all the time."
Best test match ever I watch in my life
Mother fuker umpair  2 time rong deccision .....
"I think the result of this match depends on some luck towards england and it is carry forwarded to world cup 2019,,, but some natural power has given some luck in 2019 otherwise tii 2019 they do not won any big international events"
I wont call stokes the best-allrounder at the Moment but HE IS THE best player of the MOMENT🔥
England won the world cup on luck and this match as well
"im from Pakistan, but stokes celebration gives me goosebumps, what a match winner he is."
Can't describe! It was just Fabulous from stokes..
"Man of the match Stokes and Leach,  Lyon and Umpire"
"KALLIS IN THAT TIME
STOKES IN THIS TIME"
Ben stokes is played match for only winning
"Just watched this again, 25th August, 2020, one year on. Greatest day of drama in Test Cricket, ever, on a par with Edgebaston 2005 & Headingley 1981.

Legends, Leach & Stokes. Truly memorable....great drama,... Gollum dropping the ball for the run out, plastic pints flying with the final winning four runs and what a massive noise from the crowd. Incredible."
Tim paine will always regreat about the review taken by him against stoke when it clearly pitching outside leg.
"Be honest, this isn't the first time you're watching this"
Incredible
https://youtu.be/hHOVwaV46v4
That umpire deserves a slap
What a fighter. Hat's of to ben stokes.
"Leach most amazing 1 in the world...Ben Stokes...Super Freak, did he try finishing that match at 2 runs needed with a reverse sweep :D ben stokes u beauty , reminded me off Dhoni and yuvraj a bit"
"I just love "" for Headingley 1981 read Headingley 2019"" and I've no idea why 😂"
I was there 🤣🤣🤣
16.36 The expression of a Democrat in November.
"This Shows Test Cricket Is The Real Game!!!

No T20 Can Match This Level ❤
Just Lit 🔥"
Wao Incredible
one of the best test matches? hell yes!
25 the August   ben stokes day dont forget you've seen history made
What a man you are Ben?
Incredible!!!
unbelievable incredible stokes🔥🔥
Leach saves English 17 times... Great defence under pressure...
This man can do everything from the bat . Ben Stokes 🤩
"I'm watching this over over and over again 
Love from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰❤️"
Very very lucky. Nothing else
This match was fixed
"Stokes did so many silly mistakes but so did Australian fielder, otherwise he would have been called fool for taking so high a risk at such time."
Am i the only who...Who is watching todat..I.e. 1 year exact later
"11:31 “When you have Geoffrey Boycott behind you in the commentary box clapping, you know you’ve played well.”"
True cricket is still alive in England:)
What an electrifying atmosphere:)
"13:13 good decision mate










Now skip to this
14:51"
Here on the 1st anniversary of this great game! 😍
Assalamvalakum friends actually the umpire cheted without giving it out on a lbw for strokes but I am happy for England that they won it
Thats why review must not be wasted😀
Test match of the century
Superb performance by Be Stokes...
"I’m in an Indian, this is the greatest cricket match in modern history, the emotions. The passion, the drama involved is second to none. Move over the kohli’s, smith’s etc. they are skillful cricketers, but Ben stokes you’re , i reiterate you’re the GREATEST MODERN DAY CRICKETER. You’ve just inspired an new generation of young budding cricketers to take up this game. I doff my hat."
Never get bored of watching this.
1 YEAR AGO TODAY! thank you ben stokes
it bought tears of joy at the end
"14: 34.  minutes.......on..
Ban stoke.....  Clear. Lbw....out..
But...... umpire.. decision...wrong
Decision"
Mark Nicholas really is painful to listen to
Easily the greatest test of all time.
My god..@14.01 even the umpire got freezed for 3 seconds after run out chance was missed..... Stokes played an innings of the class of Lara @153*......
A year ago... wow
Lyon The real hero
i think this is movie..am i right ??
WOW! What a finish!!!!
Greatest test match of all time
what a sensation more than 20-20 match
চমৎকার খেলা 🤩🥰
2019 is the incredible year for England cricket history 😘😍
6:53 is that Bancroft in the background putting something inside his pants AGAIN?? 😂
Greatest test knock of all time.
"Stokes didn't win the test, Joel Wilson did. Stokes was out. Small English grounds helped too. Would of been out on larger Australian or Indian grounds."
"Australia took review on wrong time when leech was batting  while pat cummins was bowling.
Nathan Lyon took ben stokes wicket when umpire didn't give him lbw.
That was the turing point of the match.
Australia team is always best.
Love and respect Australia from Pakistan 🇵🇰"
"After hitting batsmen on the helmet, compare Hazlewood's attitude to Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer immediately asking if Mohammad Rizwan was ok today (23/08/2020)."
Remarkebal  omg 😊
It's great to have cricket back after lockdown but I miss these scenes and atmosphere so much. Sport is great but crowds like this make it memorable
16:37 his expression shows he has lost  money
I don't know why but I get emotional watching such finishes.
"From Pakistan 🇵🇰 
Love to se again"
This is only match replay is better than highlighted
"Brilliant inning from ""Jack Leach"" ... My man of the match 🤓"
"Amazing match, had they have not taken DRS against Jack leach, was doing anyway.
They would have called DRS against Stokes... Which was out.
Its all pure luck to be honest"
Mitchell Johnson's commentary single-handedly brings down the entire energy-level of the match
And I just searched it for the Mark Nicholas commentary.
"cricket is the most unpredictable game in the world and if anyone disagrees , show them these highlights"
"Oh man 2am I went to bed after the 9th wicket 😳 thinking we were home, I don't think I've woken up to a bigger shock in my life"
"Luck Is always on the Side of the *Brave*
Well Done England, Well Done Stokes
Hard Luck Australia"
Put a bloke in hospital big man
Favoring of umpires let england to win ...otherwise clear LBW by nathon lyon
"The Last Four, And Cries Of Happiness"
🔥🔥 one of best test match I have ever seen
"Once ben stoke were the reason why England lost t20 world cup (That time i thought he will loss all his courage and will loss his career as well with a loser tag).
But then he changed the history and become the reason why England become world champion by winning world cup 2019. And also this test match and much more contribution from him lead the people to mark him as winner or gladiator . A true fighter"
How did he pull this off???
best test match i ever seen
Solid knock from Ben stokes what a thrilling win eng
miss the crowd in corona going matchs
"Poor empiring  , england is always loser ok"

Aus value of last reviewe
Fixed match . 5 drop catches... Run-out miss
"Best test match ever played in the history of cricket between two oldest cricket teams. It's no less than a Hollywood thriller. Ben Stokes, you beauty! Love from India 🇮🇳"
Great Great Great stokes ....He is real hero of current era
days were good before corona
"stokes body language is like yuvraj singh,"
Wow
"Would never firget this match, what a day it was, Stokey NAILED aussies!"
Best individual english inning of all time for sure
https://youtu.be/0PwT5nEg9-c
13:30 ultimate moment of stupidity reviewing that
Aus were the winners. Luck was not on thier side
whats wrong with us india pakistan why cant we play why cant we dont put politics in sports man i really want to see india pakistan test cricket and odis please god i want to see this in my life
Great love from pakistan 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
"The greatest hero for England isn't Stokes but



Umpires' wrong decisions ( whether in WC19 final or Headingley Test)"
Fortue always favor the braves
It is humbling to see what some men are capable of.
"When Ben Stokes retires, his figures won’t do him justice. There’s no way he should have won this - or the World Cup. He just has ice water running through his veins."
17:00 that slow-mo is *majestic*
That last image with the crowd in the background will make for such a great wall picture
A thriller movie based on true incident
Umpire makes wrong decisions
England won wc by luck and this match by luck
Amazing Ben Stokes.....
Josh Hazelwood biography: the bouncer to ben stokes
i can only imagine how angry buttler was
I think Australia lost this match just because of umpire’s wrong decision
Has he dropped the ashes ?
Aus miss Stark
"Test match cricket - what an unbelievable performance this was from Stokes, feel lucky to have been able to watch it live if only on the television. The way he isn’t interested in his personal milestones but then celebrates the winning runs with such passion - a true competitor. Great to watch it back."
"14:56 empire wilson, how much did you get paid for this ???"
Kiwis - how did you guys let him go??
I LOVE YOU STOKSY
Imagine if Australia had that one review left.
Wow Amazing Ben Stokes
Great All Rounder Ben Stokes❤️ Love frm Greece 🇵🇰🇬🇷
17:01 says it all 😍
15:02 The greatest single of all time. 😍
"Well played by Ben stokes..but also remember leach,he also played his part very well..."
"I am surprised that no one is talking about the wrong umpiring decision at 14:33, Australia would have still won the match."
I can't believe. Ben stokes is best man in the england team
Bhaiyo aaj mera birthday hai or aaj shamko main apni girlfriend ko kiss karunga ❤😘 uska name aanaya hai I love you aanaya
16:08  look at the appreciation
Man of the match Tim paine😂😂
history of cricket will playing
I could watch this every day
Stokes is the best all rounder in history and I don’t care who u bring up against me
Kohil  says  his name whenever he gets angry or frustrated 🥰
"Stokes is not hero
Lion is big vilen"
Ben stokes is super duper
That's why i like the test cricket most..☺
I voted for stokes as new Zealand sportsman of the year😅😄😃 didn't go down well
Who is watching this in 2020 and still has shivers down your spine when stokes hits the winning runs ?
"I havnt see such a classy batting and such  match ben strokes name is mean he is stroke maker he proved realy enjoyed this match  england got classy batmen huge love for be from pakistaniz
Zikhan"
Beyond supper!!!!!  Also luck!
But he should of been out 🤔
"As an indian best one day I witness 
England vs new Zealand world cup final
Best test I witness
England vs australia

Fearless cricketer 
Ben stokes"
"Had that review of Leach's LBW not taken ,then Oz could hv won it.
But , Stokes made all the difference and it was his day ."
"Both times (here & wc final),it couldn't have possible without poor umpiring bt u gotta appreciate the efforts of Stokes..."
Great test in cricket🏏🏏🏏 history 👏💯💯💯👍
Pane review blunder cost this match
"Virat kohli cover drive Comments
 Anderson out swinger like 
Dale Steyn yorker both like or comments"
"James Anderson like
Stuart broad comments
Please just one like for Anderson and one comments for broad"
What a poor review by Australia. Anyone who watches cricket can tell it pitched outside leg on first look. Just another example of how drs can change the complexion of the game
"The second time that summer that I paraphrased Fergie with ""Cricket...bloody hell!"""
One of the greatest match ever.. . Stokes👏🤜🤛...
Stokes is my favorite player England team
Gentlemen never celebrate
An eccentric man .. Benjamin
Its 5star innings & finish
"Why England win - 
England media - Ben stokes
Other media - poor umpiring"
BINOD and Ben Stokes
2019 was made for england.
2019 - Year of Ben Stokes!
Never waste a reiew
"Stokes didn't even raise his bat on his 100.
He screamed way too hard after winning. 

Shows his priorities"
The best bowl to a no. 11 batsman is a yorker. i don't understand why the australian bowler not bowled yorker to jack leech when he on the bat?
The greatest test innings of all time ❤️
.
Lol umpire decision is bravest ever it seems.. lol commentators speak whatever comes their stupid mouth
Poor fielding by aussie  hard luck.  Clean LBW umpire didnt gave.. as usual luck favours stokes in world cup and Ashes too.
Remember this is a test match
This match show that review is very important
Jos Buttler run out is not out
"I've lost count of how many times I've watched this. Also, how I miss the English crowd. ❤️💙"
This would not be possible without leach's one run....!
One-man Army
Some credit also goes to leech😉😉
Scripted better than Bollywood movies
Man that looks like so much fun. People and going out. Sunshine too...
spirit of england endured
"This Ashes Series main highlights:
. The making of Marnus Labuschagne 
. The comeback of Steve Smith
. Ben Stokes - the legend continues
. Jack Leach - the best wing man. 1 run matters!!!
. Nathan Lyon - survived a heart attack that very last over!!! 
. Naughty boy Dave Warner - on a new low"
This is not the real commentary is it?
"Normal cricketers:50 runs in 120 balls

Ben Stokes:Hold my bat"
Ben Stock is known for his cheating in WC 2019
All dislikes are from pandya fans
Lol ben stokes
"Great effort by Stokes and Leach..
But we all know that Aussies would've won the match if that LBW was given OUT!

Deliberate use of review, Runout missed, No review left for a sure shot LBW...it was all against Aus."
England win with the help of umpires in every greatest victory
Ben Stokes the next generation gem ❤
Gghhhhh
Hjjj
That was way more thrilling than T20 OR ODI.... 😎😎😎😎
The use of review was the plot twist any movie would have paid billions for
David Lloyd and nari Nicholas were a treat to the ears as well.
England and Stokes deserve to win but with that LBW decision makes it salty victory. great game of cricket
Best test inning after a very long time
One word - GOOSEBUMPS!
Ben stokes is a gem of a player!
Stokes is a real player.He has good cricket sence.
great ben strokes
Sir Ben Stokes👑
Leach U got Respect
Sir Stokes
"Still Remember,
I saw this LIVE on my mobile 
From INDIA ..................
ONE OF THE BEST LIVE CRICKET  MATCH I HAVE EVER SEEN 😋😋😋😋😎😎😎😎"
The greatest 1 of all time. Jack leach you are my hero. 🤩
"Ashes always excites cricket fans all over the world, simply the best cricket match of all time."
More than 10 time.this video has seen by me......
Could we tag him as a next 360° player after abd....remarkable.
Best cricketing moments till date : https://youtu.be/409pxQ6Cuhk
Ben Stokes legend
He don't celebrate till he cross 100 but the winning shot his celebration was fabulous
"0:00 - 9:20 - The Australian Bowling Show
9:21 - 16:00 - The Ben Stokes Show"
"Stokes,dhoni and Bevan will form the best odi team ever."
"Each and every thing of this test match was perfect,,, look like all was scripted but it was real, headingle 1981 and headingle 2019,,, and the lines Ben what you doing in this test match...was fantastic.. remarkable story I have ever seen,,,, Ben controlled emotions after getting his century,,, Jack leach best ever one nd level the score.... Lyon missed easy run out.... Aus wrong reviewed then Roll of umpire when he was clearly out...full of entertainment I have ever seen.."
16:59 - 17:14 for goosebumps
15 24 നിസ മഗ ഗാ... ഡ്രൂവങ്ങൾ മായല്ലെ.... ❤️❤️
"After WC 2016 le my friend-: Hardik Pandya is better alrounder than Ben Stokes...
 
Le me big fan of Ben stokes from 2016 SA Vs ENG series and even after 2016 T20 WC  :- Stokes will become best all rounder in modern day cricket ... 

My friend - Laughing 

After 2019 WC - friend Crying saying still Hardik is better than Stokes

Me- Laughing at my friend's cricket knowledge 😂😂

Ben Stokes Fans hit like 👍👍"
2 run out and wood have lost the  W CUP and the ASHES wot a superman he is
Ben stokes 🔥🔥🔥
The one hero of England is Ben stokes
greatest performance of all time from stokes love this vid
"Great how the whole of the Aussie team and staff show Stokes that respect. The clapping, pats on the back and telling him it was the best ever inning that they've had the privilege to witness and that it was a great honour to be part of. Most of all though how they said how they'll be able to tell their kids and grandkids of the great Ben Stokes..Respect Aussie team and fans for being so humble. Well done in taking the series too."
I swear to god this was the best innings I've ever seen live❤️
England's team is pro team🤩😘😘💯
Marvellous Batting.
"It was pure LUCK !!!
Two drop catches
One wrong review
One LBW but couldnt take the review
And the icing on cake
A SIMPLE FU**IN MISSED RUN-OUT BY LYON
HOW MUCH MORE LUCK DO YOU NEED NOW 🙄🙄"
Ben stokes you beauty!!❤
Root one men aeermy
"After MS Dhoni,Ben stokes is the best finisher in the World,"
"Don't know if its been said already, but the crowd's reaction to pretty much anything the English batsmen do here is just amazing, these screams of passion and love for their own country!"
That shot of him celebrating when the crowd rises behind in slow motion  is maybe the greatest bit of cricket  footage  of all time
One of The best day of my life
England ki kismat bohat achi chal raha hai world cup vhi ase jita or ashes vhi draw huha all the luck
Every LBW must be appealed to the third umpire ... this is the best thing
This is the greatest test innings I have witnessed in my entire life.
"Dropped catch, dropped catch, wasted a review for no reason, run out chance dropped. Australia choked the hell out of this game in the last 30 min."
Just realised that Botham 1981 is 19 years before the millennium and Stokes 2019 is 19 years after the millennium. could be a long wait  :)
"England are simply lucky to have the Ashes gifted to them; Nathan Lyon --- OOPS!
Nonetheless, well-played Sir Ben Stokes... Cheers!!!"
"It's a slapped and wake up call every people around the world, who dare to compare Ben strokes with any other player ( Here in India with pandiya )"
My  favorite player Ben
2019 is the year  of Ben strokes
"Hazelwood hitting Stokes helmet
... Ben will remember that"
"How many times you watch, the classic pushes your nerves every time."
One of the finest innings i had ever saw❤️
The greatest one run of all time👏👏👏👏👏
Inning like stokes comes once in 100 years
Jack leach 😍😍😍😍😍
"When you play so intensely and want to win it for your Country...
Even the luck changes it's way...
No Celebration even after the Hundred shows how desperately Stokes wanted England over the line...
Surely, those in the heavens too wanted that...
Otherwise it was not so difficult for the Aussies to take one wicket after getting England all out for 67 in 1st Innings and taking 9 wickets for 250 odd runs in the 2nd Innings...
But there was one guy who believed...
Who believed in England, who believed in himself and who believed that they could win this...
Eventually, putting all possibilities and calculations apart, HE did it...
Not to forget Leech, he too supported Stokes with soking tremendous pressure....
BENJAMIN STOKES....
YOU are one of the finest Cricketer of this Era...🙌🙌
I'm Indian, but huge fan of yours....
Thanks for showing what toughness and spirit means😉"

Yeah this is awesome but you guys dont even know kusal perrera great knock (the greatest innings ever) and also with 9 wickets down. also Y did tim paine take that useless review? The bowler clearly told no but tim paine probably wanted to waste time... see tim paine souldnt have taken a useless  review (im not australian if you are wondering)
Pakad at 6:38😅
Hearts attack for the whole of Australia
WTF..jos butler wasnt runout.. bails were already dislodged without ball by leon..once a cheater always a cheater
Why is the commentary different from what it was broadcasted? Need Nasser Hussain commentary
Maximum of Big Series England won is Questionable ?
What a player ben stokes...
England rob worldcup
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
England not perform asia pich 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Never gets old 
This guy deserves respect 
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Ben is a great finisher ❤️
For headingly 1981 and headlingly 2019
"That days cricket was easily up there in the ""Cricket feel good Hall of Fame"" with the likes of Atherton batting all day to save the game,the world cup super over, game and Devon Malcolm's 9 fer against South Africa. Terrific Entertainment."
എന്റെ പോന്നോ ഇജ്ജാതി match 😵
Australia can win but
17:00 What a sight for test cricket. Looks a like a cinematic experience.
@17:00 That's cricket for you.
"Morals of the match 
""It's not over until it's really over""

EFFORTS+LUCK=SUCCESS"""
No comments 🤐
100 % fixed match
isn’t stokes the greatest of all time ????
Superb bating ben stokes you rock
Ben Stokes is super hero
"Ben stokes is arguably greatest cricketer of this generation, he's better than kohli imo. Yes kohli is consistent but from what i saw in world cup last year, whenever england's batting line up was in trouble, he was there to fight back. Be it against sri lanka, Australia, india or new zealand. The resiliency he possesses is just unbelievable, unmatched and what makes him cricketer of the year."
The Greatest Test Innings ever played?
Ben stokes if left handed bowler...10/10....fantasy point
Remarkable match.. Ben Stokes... You are simply awesome.. കിടു...
Nathan lyon miss of the century
Bad luck aus before run-out chance Lyon and then lbw ben Stokes
Stokes is the biggest superstar in world cricket at present even bigger than Virat.
When I feel down I watch this.
Stokes is the only English player with that Australian attitude of playing the game
And umpire gets the job done for England
Present situation number  1 player Ben stokes .... From India
My favourite
This is the beauty of test cricket♥️
Man of the match dear umpire !!😀👍
The greatest single of all time..leach!!
what a match...no word to say...only had a big smile on my face after seeing situations of australia and jack leach
Historic day for England Babua.... Imagine who's the culprit ?? Pat Cummins and Tim Paine most likely .. total waste captain ..and who says Kiwis  choke all the time .. ahem..😛
Josh hazelwood is a prick
"Ben Stokes becoming known for  ""finest hours."" The last hour at Headingley and the first hour on Day 5 of the 2020 second test against the West Indies on Monday to set up the declaration at 129-3 declared. Stokes 78 not out as England plundered 92 runs in 11 overs to set up the West Indies target of 312. 😁🏏"
17:00 Feel the joy🙌🏻😎
"Incredible match and amazing innings, Everything went right that day for England. Australia wasting their review, Nathan Lyon letting the presssure get to him and the umpire not calling it correctly."
If we see by 0.25 playback speed at 14:34 it seems that there are two deflections and it seems going down leg stump at first deflection but tracker tracked second deflection and it looked like plumb but it wasn't
The most important single ever
"Unreal. Arguably the greatest single one-off performance I have ever seen in sport. Better than Messi, Ronaldo, Federer, and O'Sullivan. Some of those shots defied belief. Genius."
Every team wants player like Ben Stokes...
Can't  be real. Looks like fiction
I think Australia lost the match because there was no starc. He would have cleaned the tailenders spot on.jack leach wouldn't have survived by hus reverse swinging Yorkers. Starc is the best bagger of tailenders Channge my mind
14:05 my reactions when someone says Pandya better than Stokes 😂😂
That 1 run is more worthy than hundred hundreds.
One of the greatest innings ever... Ben stokes good too
He is best all rounder
I don't know how many times I've watched this video. Truly amazing performance by Ben. What a summer it was for ECB!
A complete Cricketer
Australian fielding was on all time low in those last few moments....
Unbelievable.....
Watching in lockdown one of the best match🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Never got tired to this beautiful one man army innings from Pakistan
The best test cricket match that i have ever seen..
Kohli can never produce this kind of stuff in all 3 semifinals he failed badly. Its doesn't matter how many 100s you make when you can't win at major times. Ben don't even bother to celebrate his 100 bcz his prime focus was to win.
Always looking for win the game....... Ben stokes best all-rounder l ever seen
What a match this is
Aussies should have been much better in the field ig 😅 anyways inspite of the chances it's a great innings by stokes

"The greatest test inning i seen....
Give goosebumps even today..."
"This is arguably one of the top 5 test knocks of all time.This kind of 'braveheart' batting is possible only because these batsmen play the limited & ultra limited over games. Take a bow, Stokes."
5:22 that was not out
Test cricket at its best

"He is the best cricketer of this era without any doubt , there may be better batsmen or bowler no one is better cricketer than him , you are remarkable man we love you"
Carlos brathwaite broke stokes heart and Stokes broke heart of Australia in this test and nz at final worldcup...Stokes lead 2:1
Kudos to England crowd.
Nice
"Benjamin stokes


Stoksy 




In future

My kids will tell







Sir Ben stokes 🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬🇬"
The greatest 1 of all time for England goes to Jack Leach. His perseverance was required at that time. Ben probably is the greatest English cricketer of modern era
Ben Stokes 👌
"Aus: We won
Stokes: Hold my beer"
Ben stokes you beauty love you
Ben stokes you beauty love you
Fixed match......
One lucky man - ben
"No way no no way......

Superb Stokes
Woman announcer ruins it. Too annoying and speaking nonsense.
On of the best  match in the history of the Game
"2019 stoke hero 
2020 carona hero"
He Neither Celebrated his 50 nor 100.... He did all at one after winning runs
Greatest innings after kusal prera innings..(153*)...what do you think guys?
14:04. ”That is too much for everybody.. It is as simple as that.Too much”
I had goosebumps watching this match.. Ben Beauty Stokes
"at times I believe Stokes is not human, he is extra ordinary. the catches he takes, heroics with both bat and ball. he is one of the strong pillars of England's world cup winning team"
What are the amazing day what will never forget what a legend
nice man
England is so lucky
"Dont watch this video
https://youtu.be/WQBs9towoEc"
He didn't celebrate 50 or 100 until the job gets done
Leach really justified his name... Stuck on the crease like leech 🤣
But credit goes to leach
Pure goose bumps
These kind of match could bring back England's cricket audiences. And make cricket more popular like before.
"Umpire was such big asshole 
Come on Aussies"
As a winner cricketer no one like Ben stocks in this time
"I quit my job thanks to, *l a z y h o m e p r o .c l u b*"
If u think test match is boring watch this u will never say it again just saw the innings of life can watch this in numbers of time
"This match was a movie,  and the climax was such chilling."
Then Flintoff now Stokes
5:04 not the right decision but that decision turn out best for England
Ben stokes is the hero
"He did reverse sweep when 2 run was left !!
Ha ha if you are cricketer you won’t ever take this risk !"
"I quit my job with the help of, *l a z y h o m e p r o .c l u b*"
Kya kismat ha bhai ki😁😁😁
Great atmosphere. Fantastic. From an aussie.
player of the world

Greatest test match
Just wow
Stokes: For the Queen! And the great British empire!
No 1 stoke the greatest all rounder in the world
"MSD SHOULD BE CAPTAIN OF CA FOR THIS MATCH
RESULT WOULD BE DIFFERENT"
The pakistanies were also having a ben stokes (Abdul Razzaq) in past but they did'nt used him.
There is a no substitute of ben stokes.
Those two innings stokes played in 2019 one in wc final was the highlights of the year.
All highest runchase of England in test is versus Australia and New Zealand
Umpires won the World cup for England like this match.
Dangerman Ben stokes
Mark Nicholas voice added more glimpses to the video.
"11:19 no celebration, my job is not done yet."
Ben Stokes World's No.1 All Rounder 😚😚😚😚😚😚😚😚
Wow 😳BEN
"If it were a movie, it would have been criticised for being very unrealistic!!"
All time best .. Against the best
My first ever feelings to aus
"Australia should have won
But the audience energy boosted England
Stokes made the difference"
Bad luck Australia
One man army
It was fabulous inning by Ben Stokes 🥰
No 1 All Rounder stokes 💪
what a match one of the best i have ever seen test cricket at its best
2019 was the year when lady luck had decided to sleep with the English. 😁
That review 13:21! What was Tim Paine thinking?
"When u have talent+ luck together at the same time a run out chance miss,a catch miss,a wrong umpire decision and those killer sixes amazing"
The platinum standard of test cricket.
13:37 WOW
"breaking news 
Ben stokes hits 135*
The score is 362-9"
"Barmy army top top support no matter where they go they show there class. 

What a game what an innings 🙌🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿"
2019 belongs to Ben great stokes most passionate cricketer of world cricket huge fan from lahore Pakistan 👍👍👍
I don't know how many time I watched this video but want again and again ❤️❤️❤️❤️ love from Pakistan
"People who are great fan of T-20 cricket, can you guys suggest me a better t-20 match than this test match? I bet you can't.  Test cricket has something special which no other cricket format has."
Ic match ko jitna dekho itna kam hai love you Stoke
"11:53 He's gone agaaain...He's Gone agaaain... 
Gives me goosebumps every time."
I saw this match live on TV☺️☺️
"This is the greatest innings ever in a Test match Cricket ..

And people are comparing Stokes with Pandya 🤪🤣"
One bad reviews Australian lose the match. @last minute review
Wow!
"Any other side would be disheartened if said to score (just not get out) some 70 runs for last wicket against australian lineup..
Benstokes: hold my beer."
There is another video with different Commentator?? How is it possible ....
Hello everyone i am knocking your generous heart to kindly SUBSCRIBE my channel please because i am aspiring youtuber. help me to make more subscriber please. thank you
Australia completely on pressure...Year 2019 name for Benstokes what a player with bat and boll amazing..👍
"I am an  Indian
and I will be remember this mach mach as  ""BEN'S Test "" forever ....🔥🔥🔥"
Any cricket team don't mess with that man
"great player
brave decision at that stage of game"
Again I came here to watch last wicket run out has been missed by N Lyon... Bad luck and good luck to England...
Bounderful match
Lyon ruined it
"You have to hand it to the Ausralians - just lost a match they ought to have won yet each end every one of them went up to the English guys and said 'well played mate'. Not sure with roles reversed the English team would have done the same, we'll never know but what the Aussies did was truly sportsman like."
Ben stokes is completely a next level cricketer
Never gets old.
@5:22 that wasnt out for God's sake. Lyon the cheater!
They need to get rid from those lady commentators..Boring.
Ben Stokes - The killing machine of 2019
Luck was really on the side of Ben Stokes during this ashes and also during the World Cup final. But this surely seemed fixed at points especially the way Lyon missed out on the run out and umpire's wrong decision. But then I feel satisfying all such things happening to Aussies coz they have always been biggest cheaters and sledgers starting from the great legendary cheater Ponting.
this kind of games can bring people back to test cricket. Amazing!!!
Omg no word 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Literally wonderful batting.
One of the most thrilled test match lot of dramas
9:21 OMG... Commentary...
Prefer Nasser Hussain's commentary
Australia team bad luck
And people say test cricket is boring.
Feels like a movie
"Best test match of the world ,hero ben stokes
Best one day match of the world ,hero ben stokes"
It's just a good time for stokes
England
when i started to watch highlights i knew the result but every ball gives me high blood pressure.
Pure luck.... Warner 2 catches and run out by Lyon....these are hepled to Ben stokes
Ben Stokes ko maata aa gayee thhi us din..:-)
that shot of stokes punching the air with the crowd behind him in slow motion must be the best piece of sporting cinematography in years
"Its gentleman game and i'm thinking right now how many gentleman would hv got Heart Attack that day cz my heatbeat is too much high even on wtchng highlights wht a player this man is no Eng player was ever fvrt for me but Ben Stock is my frst english fvrt player 
This match is a true Example of true Cricket ❤"
Absolute brilliant 😍
"I am in India 🇮🇳 my age just  23 , Ben Stoke is all time fvrt all round for me I ever seen in my career"
Hhahahaha.... Amazing ♥ ♥ ♥ Stoke storkes.. ♥ 😘
Ban strock is great players
Super England 🙌💪👏💪👏👏👏👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
"Best test innging🖤
From 🇱🇰"
ben stokes is the freakin intelligent player who can win his england team at any moment
"2019, the year made for ben stokes..."
Retain ashes
"Stokes and Leach commentary highlights

Great shot! Fantastic entertainment 
Incredible! This guy is a freak
100 for Ben Stokes! An innings that keeps the ashes alive
Ayyyyy.. six! Ben what are you doing to this cricket match??
It’s… six more! (yelling in commentary box) No way man! Ben Stokes you beauty!
It’s catchable… it’s dropped it’s dropped!
It’s a boundary .. is it? It is it is! It’s another boundary
Keep your cool Ben, 9 to win…
It’s six! It’s six! (yelling in commentary box) Ben Stokes has hit it for six!
Oh no there’s a run out, no way (screaming yelling in commentary box) He’s dropped it! Nathan Lyon has dropped it!
It’s too much for everybody it’s as simple as that, it’s too much
Yes England have tied the match - Jack Leach you are my hero, the greatest 1 of all time
Here we go then, the scores all level (Sound of ball being smacked hard) YEEESSS! (Stokes and crowd roaring) 
The greatest test match innings ever played, England triumph against the odds. A last wicket partnership we’ll never forget 
We’ll never forget the best unbeaten single *ever* made, by Jack Leach"
Where are the England player while the crowd goes berserk? Why aren’t they mobbing Stokes?
What is this? I heard about Mr. Luck but here I can see clearly Mr. Luck on the ground.
Ben stokes is currently best all-rounder in the world...
"Ben Stokes' unbelievable sportsman 
Badluck as lbw turn down and missed run out opportunity but what a knock from ben stokes"
What a test match
Crap batting.
What a match
I’m Australian...Ben Stokes is a super hero
"This is the best script no writer can write 

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx2_1I8tR2p93D_fXP0Nbvw"
"Australia: You're not going to win from this situation.
Leach and Stokes: Hold my tea."
I've watched this 1000 times yet am still terrified that each time Billy Doctrove will give Ben Stokes OUT LBW !
How lucky this guy is and how lucky the year 2019 was for him... first this match and than the world cup final..... was  stadium  also the same for both the matches.....?????
"Jack leach played 17 balls at number 10. Test is best when staying matters than scoring runs. 
Ben stokes off course extra ordinary."
"It's not movie but a reality match. 
Yeah he is a real fighter and multitalented. He showed it in Wc final also. This match was a trailer and wc final was climax of this incredible talent .Now many more movies will come when he will do the same. What a great test match this is and that Wc final is the best final ever and will be best forever. Both the matches"
10:39 - so gay 🤣
If I feel a bit down I watch this. Does the trick every time. I watched it live and couldn’t believe it. Part of me still can’t believe it. Absolutely brilliant.
What if Aussies had a review
Fix match
Fix match
17:05 Pints in the air moment!
Ben stokes is a mirror image of Jaques Kallis.... What a amzing player both of them are definitely in all time Test XI
Warner at 14:00. Priceless
Unbelievable super hero Ben stokes
Not a Cricket fan but I still think Cricket has the potential to be one of the greatest and most popular world sport. It's rather unfortunate that inefficient bureaucracy has impeded its growth around the world. It has actually seen a decline in popularity in several countries outside the subcontinent. Real shame.
Australia in this match and New-Zealand in WC19 final lost because of silly mistakes and both times eng were lucky enough to capitalise on that...😅😅
"Match fixed even, a blind can, see"
Ben Stokes has to be the greatest match-winner of the decade!
13:29 big mistake
Taunton Lara! Taunton Lara!
Till now I get boosbumps seeing this innings... Hats off to Mr Stokes lots of love from India
Fantastic🤘🤘
Kusal Janith Perera's inning was better he scored more runs 153* he wasn't dropped two times he scored more runs than stokes and he didn't have bad umpiring decisions that favored him
Nice
Memorable memorable match
Kusal perera played better than this without any luck😑
17:03
"this is unfair , poor umpiring....stokes was clearly out....but no reviews left...who made ony 2 reviews available...y is 2 reviews.. umpire may make mistake is this the reason.. wat if the umpire makes multiple mistakes..do we need the decisions of umpires anymore.. go for 3rd umpire for any dismissal....this win was luck just like the world cup"
Best match that I have ever seen✍️
FORTIS FORTUNAADUVIAT
Jos Butler!
Apologies His Butler
Did anybody notice Root was not out! Nathan Lyon broke the stumps with his hands not the ball!!!!
Decision would changed the result

Every Aussie cried at the end
Ben stokes love you
Most amazing test match i ever watched
"Life is like batting in cricket, everyone's out there to get you and you just have one buddy but you are pretty much on your own. The bouncers, the bruises the pressure to keep going and then one day everything clicks. This is why I love this innings, Ben fought, he got lucky and he got fearless, there was just no stopping him and he made it in the nick of time.. I love this innings.."
"I was at the oval when KP hit 158 and we won the Ashes in 05. Couldn't believe I'd see a better knock in my life. Amazing, even after the 3rd or 4th watch"
Ashes is truely alive and kicking due to one man name Ben stokes
This is for people who say test match is boring. Hell of Emotions
best inning i have ever seen in my life.82 runs of partnership with leach and only 1 run contributed by leach.and that 8 consicutive sixes
"My Dad told me about : *Andrew flintuff*
I'll tell my kids about : *Ben stokes*"
Ben Stokes you are a hero and what a match.
"Recommend this to Americans who think test cricket is ""boring""."
Luck favoured the brave. Nothing else. Surely Aussies messed and slipped the victory.
I am a England. Fan
Ben Stoks you are a hero
Kudos to Leach as well...just staying in
I have seen this match live after  2nd sessions.Every ball brings some excitation.The reverse short on lyone was amazing.Runout missed was turning point of this tensed match.One of the best match in my live
One of the best innings I have seen
Is it just the camera angles but it looks to me that the ball never hit the wicket in Jos Buttler's run out?
More exciting than any World Cup final 😁
Best player ever. No 1 finisher
This is the greatest test match in the cricket history....nd ben stokes make it special💝
Come on umpire it's out... already...🤦
luck always favours the brave 👍👍
"Breath taking innings of stokes
Heroic defence of leach"
"Lot of people like me still re-watching this in LOCKDOWN ...
#UnbelievableBenStokes ❤️"
Journey from the 2016 t20 world cup final to 2019 ashes and cricket world cup..Ben Stokes
That's exaclty how I'd have won a cricket match on playstation.
"I watched this live !!!
What is this shot 11:37 stokes !!!"
lol he was clearly out.......England won with the help of umpire
Super nice
England's Dhoni.
Ben stokes has taught me about life. World cup and this match made long lasting inpact on my mind.
Seeing Lyon come undone....excellent. 'Sandpaper? What sandpaper.'
Ben Stokes u beauty ❤️
2nd best ever in 4th innings
Take a bow Ben stokes
"Three catches drop
Lost review unnecessarily (aus)
Gave a single to leach 
Last run out missed 

And many more ...

Was that match fixed ?"
Super
unstoppable stokes love and respect from pakistan peshawar
The most important 1 run scored in cricket history  by Jack Leach ladies & gentlemen.
"Stokes is a fine cricketer, let's see how he fares when the crowd isn't with him. Maybe in the next ashes in oz.."
Treat to eye

The greatest and the most dramatic test match ever
Ben strokes❣️❣️
Fucking nail biting.
Wish india had someone like stokes
Bestest knock ever i've seen in my.entire life
This is the greatest test innings ever ! Saying this as an Indian having seen VVS Laxman 281 in 2001. Same opponent - Australia
"'When you have Geoffrey Boycott clapping in the balcony, you know you have played well'"
once again umpire played well not giving lbw
This was better than heroin at the time :)
"This is what all of England miss out on, because Test Cricket is only available on subscription services."
one of the best fixed matches in recent cricketing history
"This will never get old... amazing game, watched it live and I can still feel the same nervous excitement that I felt that day"
"top 10 unbelievable  shots in cricket ever you must watch
https://youtu.be/hRwthYTYGuM"
The best test innings of modern era. #Stokes
16:38 it's so amazing feeling.. when you support eng in this match . Ohh my god 😆
11:03 never ever heard such a huge cheer for a solid defensive shot for no runs! Thanks for including it in the highlights.
The crowd for a test match was unbelievable. I can only see such a passionate crowd only at Eden gardens and MCG.The greatest innings and greatest test match in history of cricket
Virat always says benstokes
I love the symmetry between 1981 and 2019 exactly 19 years either side of the  millennium. Botham. Stokes. Headingley.
Happy birthday benny
Have you ever script of a test match like that?. I bet you haven't. I have watched it more than 15 times. Watching it again. Thank you Ben stokes for all of this. Missing Nasser Hossain and Atherton's Commentry.
"A second bad umpiring decision give england second important win and a second ""heroic performance "" by Ben stokes he was out leg before with two runs to win just like the world cup final"
Great job
Its also an umpiring mistake stokes got lbd totally three times.
Poor empire  it was clear ibw
do check out our video on cricket post covid-19 and more - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKhp25Ngn8E&feature=youtu.be
First and final ball in the video..wow what a performance and what a reply!!
Happy Birthday Sir Ben Stokes 😍😍
The greatest 4th innings ever made by any batsman from the circumstances he was in...Much like Brian Lara's 4th innings score against Aussies in 1999.
Happy birthday to you . Cham
Wtf 😕....... no one can expect England won this match ...... Ben stock also 😅😅
"It was Day 4
Why was stokes playing like that it was Day 5??????"
"Umpire sympathy in last with Ben stokes
Great inning fired up"
@13.21 .....one of the dumbest decisions of all time by captain tim
"ഈജാതി മാച്ച് 😁😁👌👌👌 
ഒറ്റ പേര് ben stoke 💞💞💕"
I don't know why but everytime I see the thumbnail I just naturally click it.
Again tks umpires 😂😂
"One of them, where you'll always remember where you were"
I received the phone phone call at lunch this day that my Nan had passed away. I had a cry in the bathroom and then sat through every ball for the rest of the day. What a spectacle. Thank you Stokesy for making it so memorable.
"looks to be a fixed match. lot of dropped catches, misfieldings, rarely expect from aussies. also not forget the bizzare drs for bowl pitching outside leg from a wicketkeeper captain. umpire denying staright forward lbw decision only an idiot will believe this is a real cricket"
Love from Pakistan.  What a cricketer he is! watched it more than ten times yet it feels so fun to watch. LOVE YOU SIR BEN STOKES.
Remarkable cricketer Ben stokes superman stuff..
What an innings by Ben Stokes. Simply wow 🤩 ...
most number of pints launched in the air after the kieran trippier goal at the world cup.
Nathon lyon Are you kidding me man.....
awesome
We love Eng😍😍😍🎯🎯🎯🎯😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰😎😎😎😎😎
who is thinking that 2020 baddest year
Worst umpiring by John Wilson 😈!!!!!????
This day 25th August 2019 I can never forgot as my sister was born and Ben stokes heroics
England luck always favours them
"I watched this live👌👌
Stokes you beauty"
Happy birthday Ben stockes
It's all about Ben stokes.he is world's finest all rounder at the moment and will remain for more some years in the future.
This one is one of the best innings I have ever seen in test cricket matches. Respect to Ben Stokes❤
It was the best cricket test match ever..
"Taking absolutely nothing away from the most incredible innings by stokes. But England didn't win that match, the Australians lost it. From the wasted review to the missed run out, you would've thought they were trying to lose the match. Regardless, that is hands out the greatest effort I have ever seen by a single batsman"
Incredible Ben stokes
Amazing partnership....
Who wonder to Need 2 runs to win England.
"Who's watching this on 4th June today?
Happy birthday Ben Stokes!"
A kiwi making u win the match which was played btw kangaroos and the british🤣🤣🤣
I won 200 pounds. Thankyou stokes.👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
I watch this clip again n again. ....
ECB lovely
"HBD Stokes

Why Lbws are not given out"
Ben stokes played unbeleiveable

"CWC 19 final :- Thanks to Dharmsena

Is ben strokes related to andrew flintoof somehow??
Happy birthday to you Ben stocks
Ben stokes became my hero after the world cup final and this match
Happy birthday Ben strokes
11:01 Mark Nicholas on fire ❤
"Lot of luck going towards England's way, but hey you dont call Ben Stokes the best All-rounder of this new generation for nothing!
What a player."
Happy birthday Ben stokes
Happy birthday sir benjamin stokes.
Happy Birthday Benjamin Stokes 😍
Where is Nasir Hussain ?
Forget lockdown you'll be watching this no matter what's going on.
"Ben Stokes saved the World Cup
Ben Stokes saved the Test Match

T20 World Cup? Will Ben Stokes save England again???"
Stokes all time great inning belive that
Umpire also help england for win this test match
"HEADINGLEY
19 years before 2000 19 Years after 2000 Two historical matches"
"Ben Stokes is so much result oriented that I have a feeling if England would ever require 100 runs to win off 25 balls, he'd somehow manage to bring England home."
It's not 'Wilson' it's called bad game management. Why waste a review like that?
Kusal janith perera's inning is far far better than this...umpires help is the key factor here
He deserves the ashes!! What a player Ben stokes
Incredible all the way through..... Mr Ben.... you rock!
"Misused the review
Happens
Warrior knock"
"I dunno why anyone watches cricket, it's such a boring game LOL."
ben stokes is amazing player he is playing best in pressarulise situation i am addict this video bcoz this match one handed for aus but then also make win and he played like 2020 cricket. bcoz of him one day wc win eng
One of the greatest test matches.🔥🔥🔥
This still brings a tear to the eye.
England have really solid playmakers up front they are all great impeccable players
Feel for the aussies if they used their reviews well they could have won this match
Joe Wilson and England win an incredible test match!
"Greatest test chase in the history? My foot. This innings is just tons of missed catches, close calls near boundary, bad umpiring decisions and Aussies acting like little lilies under pressure."
Hard luck to Aussies...  England won by luck...
Fighter My Fav #Stokesy
Amaizing
"Best cricketer currently..bats,bowls,fields..everything he does apart from.wicket keeping..I have not seen such a test innings in last 25yrs...scoring with 1 wicket in hand..only  1 test match I remember is vvs and dravid in 2001..again it was against aussies"
"Whattt an innings....
             Whattt an innings!!!!"
This was the greatest ever test match played.One can watched billions of times.Amazing ....greatest game of cricket.BEN STOKES...love u man.
"The world....England need a miracle.
Stokes.....I've got this....."
Man of the match - umpire wilson
Nothing short of a real thriller movie
"What an absolutely insane innings. What a heroic cricketer. Take a bow, Ben Stokes."
"The best all-rounder after flintoff,,, Sir Ben Stokes 🤘🤘"
സ്റ്റോക്സ് സമ്മതിച്ചു
Ben stokes your the great all-rounder
"Maza agya dekh kar
Superb awesome"
What a shot at 17:12 ... Mind-blowing... Stokes the Genius
"Incredible innings by ben stokes,"
Felt so BAD for Nathon Lyon :(.
My palm are sweaty even watching the highlights 😁 imagine what Jack leach must have gone through....🙏
Thanks to Mr. Wilson
This is a master piece by Ben 😁😂
2019 is Synonym of Ben Stokes Heroism....
After Dhoni I like Ben stokes. Love from India
Greatest test match in history will always be remembered.
I'm still thinking about that Bravery commentary..      -3.51
Real winner aus
i think Kusal Pereras'  inning is best
Unbelievable 👌👌
Game changer for every format ♎
Thisara Perera has done this already on 16 Feb 2019 against South Africa. https://youtu.be/Ef6cmkRSK94
Watched this in the early hours of the morning in Taiwan. As an expat this moment will never be beaten. People around me who do not understand cricket had no idea of the rollercoaster of  emotions I was having at that time. Pure brilliance. Well done to Leach too.
Which Could be the most fabulous test innings between KUSAL JANITH PERERA  In Durban & Ben Stockes in Leeds  ?
Super hero Ben stokes.
"Wow a awesome batting innings!!!!
But I have to say that Kusal Perera from Sri Lanka has the greatest batting innings ever!
It’s sad to say that no one knows that...."
The highlights of this day needs to be every ball.
Wrong umpiring decision in the last over of the WC Final; wrong umpiring decision against Lyon here! England have ridden on their luck...
"Couple of bad lucks for Australia 
The runout
And the lbw"
"Ben stokes didnt celebrate his 50 or his 100 but only the England victory. What a focus he had and what a team man he is. He knows his century is not important, only England victory.."
"The last review by Australia cost them the match. Lyon missed a run out and created a chance but umpire turned down the appeal. Technically, like how NZ won the world cup, Australia won this match."
Splendid innings by Ben Stokes
"8:03 stand lady ....

      Umpire see this is Six 😀😀"
Criminal review from Paine and Cummins that.
Ben stokes is amazing jack leach you played  most valuable innings of your life
i can't forget this day. what a day for stokes. he is best allrounder to play the game after kallis.
That was brutal strike over auses
Stokes for Labour leader!
Unbelievable test match both team won the heart
Why am I keep watching this I think I am addicted to it what game ❤️🇦🇫
"Mr. Hazelwood, thanks for 0:12 - i still believe that moment caused Stokes to really knuckle down and concentrate far more than normal. It was similar to how i saw KP. The more you chat/chirp/sledge/target certain players, the better they play. (Maybe i'll find an interview with Stokes and see how far wrong I am).
Either way, it was a fantastic match and a thrilling conclusion. Im still blown away by what Big Ben did.
Hope everyone is doing good."
Looks like Buttler was not out run out as the fielder dropped the ball before breaking the stumps. So both sides had a bit of bad luck.
No other  cricket match was dramatic than this one..
Greatest batting partnership with fair share of luck as well
One man Show.. You Beauty Ben Stokes..
ODI's are fun. But Test cricket is the best.
One of the greatest test match ever
One man army Ben stock
Stuart Broad's lbw appeal  😂
The same Been Stokes who scored 5 consecutive 'duck's early in his test career...
"Every boundary scored after 11:40, the crowd sounds like an EPL crowd when a goal is scored"
"13:21 That review changed everything... 
Else result could've been different..
14:33"
Why umpire  didn't giving last lbw his clean hitting stump but no review  have Australia  ...definitely  this match Australia  win
Nathan lyon 😂
Nathan lyon naay akhar pr hara dia
Trully incredible... One of my fav innings
You should never take unnecessary review. England had another match with SL where SL was saved by a second last ball review....
I was born 1995 this is the best innings I’ve ever seen And I’ve been saying this over and over Ben stokes is top 5 best all rounders ever played and one of England’s greatest
One of the Greatest warrior of England Test Cricket
Long live the Test Cricket
Fixed match
"One of the epic line spoken being ""THE GREATEST ONE OF ALL TIME"" at 15:16 for the single taken by jack leach whose contribution is nearly equal as that of stokes"
Leach scored only one😀😀😀
Bill llory...tony greig would be the perfect commentators for this innings.
https://youtu.be/JUiBsfseqBU
https://youtu.be/8RuEFRMXjLU
"Absolutely incredible by Ben Stokes 
 Congratulations to 
      English Team"
Every one raving abt Ben stokes and some are raving abt leach. But the legend is none other than Nathan Lyon. 😆😆😂🤣
I think this is fixed
*Ben stokes vera level batsman 💪 from india 🇮🇳*
Goosebumps everytime i see this video.. This is test match ladies and gentlemen ❤️❤️
# Ben stokes
Goosebumps brothers.. intense af match
Can't get tired of watching the end😍
Eng hero
Want to become an all-rounder like Ben stokes
"England is my all time favorite, I am from Pakistan first time I was the only person who said that England will be the winner of ashes and world cup winner of 2019"
Hello mfkr hezzelwood ....
Ben stokes: the name is enough
"Watching this cricket match was much useful for me to overcome quarantine fatigue,,awesome"
One of the greatest howler in the test cricket's history by Nathan Lyon....And also one of the most exciting knock too from Ben Stokes!!!
"This was the best sporting event I ever went to, boiling hot, packed ground, Aussies full of swagger, well and truly put in their place. And I'm not even English!"
Lucky person ben stokes...
Josh butler runs out like guptil wc 🏆🏆🏆
You see these magical scenes and just understand that in these Covid days any sport played in front of empty stands is a farce - played solely for contractual obligations and for money - fans make sporting events just as much as the athletes involved.  Chilli and rice without the chilli is just boring plain white rice.....
"939k views... Most of them watched it live then watched the highlights million times again came here
😅😅Just like me"
Srry for Australia...poor umpiring
"From ""Remember the name "" to ""cut away for four"" , Ben Stokes has proved himself"
That unwanted review from Pattinson though.. Aussies would have reviewed the Lyon LBW call.. that run out missed.. that single by leach.. who writes the script??? Brilliant brilliant game of cricket
no words to express what i just witness......thanks stokes
The greatest single in the ashes history
"I rate way him above Michael Bevan. But this is not the greatest test match ever. Kindly see Ind vs Aus 2001 at Kolkata, Eden Gardens"
"Stokesy if you were Indian ,you would have known the perks of being a cricketer in this world !"
"This is insane that runout mischance,lbw no review and how stokes did it"
It's awesome
Stokes is 70% Talent + 30% Luck
"രോമാഞ്ചം സ്റ്റോക്‌സ്,,"
Paine lost the crucial review
Ben stokes is a gem
67 I repeat 67 !
Greatest
One of the greatest test match in the history of test. And I saw it live on tv...
"that was a lucky day for ben & england...quite bad luck for aussies..
But cheer up for huge crowd there👍"
Nerves of steel. Skills beyond ordinary. Best cricketer of this era in my book. BEN the legendary STOKES!
F...k off e.d
70 percent of world cup ben stokes made eng win lol 30 percent was cheating 🥰😂🤣
World number 1 all-rounder Ben stokes
unreal stokes!
Remember the name ....
That was scary blow off Hazelwood's delivery mate!
"watch batting of this 9 yrs old 
https://youtu.be/VDRJdYiF99A"
wow
1 * = 135 *
remember the name #ben stokes#
"We, Indians, have always given tremendous support to The Ashes. This test match was insane!"
I never liked stokes before this day..
"After long time I have seen such an innings in test match the way BEN played. 
That 1 run contribution was icing on the CAKE."
Luck favours England both in this match and WC 2019. BUT Stokes talent never to be under estimated. He is a RockStar of Cricket.
"Ben stokes only play for team after 100 he even can't celebrate because he know be needs to score more runs for team victory
That's sportman spirit"
14:12 Has he dropped the Ashes
16:59 to 17:14  15 seconds of pure ecstacy!!!
BravO...... 🔥
This was epic... Unbelievable.. one of the best ever innings of test cricket by Benjamin Strokes..
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5xHUUWNPlg     I'd say THIS is the greatest test series EVER !!! first whitewash since 1921...
16:59 wow awesome climax 🔥🔥🔥
बहुत-बहुत
17:12 amazing moment
Truly Incredible Thanks England  Cricket  Superb !!
This is Test cricket ♥️
please live this ashes match
Jack Leach ...Specsavers...theres a pun in there somewhere
That shows how mentally strong person ben stokes is.as cool as a cucumber in these stressfull situation big fan ben stokes
Watching on Quarantine.. So Much pressure... Ben stokes A real master all rounder
Bairstow is future of cricket...
We all miss cricket......during this lockdown 😥😥😥😥
Test match of the Year💗
England had lot of luck in this innings despite heroic performance of Ben
My favourite match
Who all are still watching after 1 year?
Was butler runout?
ben stokes  hero
Ben Stocks 55
Come on England let's fall in love with cricket once again
Ben stock out before 2 runs to need.actually aus win .Ben stock is a good player also.
Ben stokes was best is best and always he is best who are fans of sir Ben stokes hit like👌👍👍👍👍
The greatest english innings of all time. Marred by that LBW call at 2 to win though....But luck evens out with time. The Aussies has so much of that to give I believe over the years if you know what I mean......especially that acquired from the 99 World Cup semifinal.
"If an ASEAN team had won a match like this, the whole team would have come on the field and danced with Stokes in their heads 🙆
But the funny thing is that not a single player from England came on the field and everyone is rejoicing in the dressing room 🙄🙄"
"A perfect example of never lose hope. 
Australia lost hope In the last second over and they took the unnecessary review for Leach's LBW. If they wouldn't have taken it they could use it for Stokes' LBW(which was clear out) and win. On the other side, Stokes kept hope alive and won spectacularly."
"I cried for 10 minutes like a baby.
Oh my god.
If u have given 100%  of urself, God would have helped u .
Thanks ASHES for making test cricket alive.
For me its all time best live test match i've ever watch.
STOKES ,  what a heroic performence u gave."
what a player ben is...!!!
A catch dropped. Couple of misfields. Bad reviews. Not out on dead plumb. Missed a simple run out. An asian team would have been declared clear fixture for this match.
"Stokes: One of the greatest test match centuries ever.
Leech: The greatest single ever scored.

God...this is cricket in it's purest form- not some bowlers' plundering premier league."
Its the best test match played ever in the history of cricket###benstokes truely a superhuman😍😍
Match was fixed
17:05
"I was so so lucky that I could watch this match live , did you ???"
Nerves of steel.. Benjamin Stokes
Destroyed aus bowling mr stroks excellent alrounder
"Stokes,leach and umpire played their best innings."
Best match I've seen ever 😍😍 Still i am watching highlights 😋
fortune favors the Brave.
One of the best match forever
Saying hi to Ben cuz you know he keeps comming back to watch
I would never forget that moment when stokes hit the winning run.... I jumped on the roof.. Punching in the air and ....uff what a match;-);-);-that's why test crickt is the best form of cricket.
Best finisher
The one run by leachy worth alot
Ben stokes best all rounder
Most superb bating ever
Just unbelievable innings
"Highest Individual Scores in ODI ' Top 10 Cricket Stars

umpire very wrong decision on lyon ball
England is cheater
Best voice of Mark Nicolas
"No, Words left to describe stokes😱😱"
Pure class ... one of the best inning in test history I ever noticed 👌🏼
one of great match in history of test cricket.  Ben u beauty....
When others team play in England we get cricket vibes and when ashes is played we get sporting vibes like FIFA world cup
Always dhrmacena save England
Jack leach you are my hero . Ben you done everything to england cricket demands. I remember you from t20 wc to ODI wc . You are a champion man.
Ben stoke was hero of 2019
"That is up there with Botham's win in Australia 30 years ago, fantastic Ben. I reverse sweep 6, impossible and lifting it over the keeper for a 6 never seen that before either. And both heroic innings against the Ausis, what more could any man want? I will have to watch that again...a couple of dozen times an antidote for the virus for sure."
Such a overrated player
fix
Who come tik tok
What a game Stokes fabulous
Fantastic  match and Ben stokes
Take a bow ECB for making such videos. You guys are the best in creating highlights
Not the biggest cricket fan so maybe I missed something but how was Buttler run out? When the keeper dislodged the bails the ball was bouncing about round his legs.
Did anyone notice with Butlers run out that the ball went through Lyons legs and he dislodged the bails without having the ball in his hand. If he was honest he would have told the umpire and allowed Butler to continue batting
Stokes amZing after world cup win
He is a genius player....
What a player
Another unforgettable inning by Ben stroke and There was obviously no need for the Last review Australia took desperation was understood but Australian captain had surrendered at that moment  . Learn from MS DHONI how to control your nerves and stay calm until it’s over
what was the need take the review by tim pain  when Pattinson says no
One of the best 🖤
Truly remarkable what a player Ben stokes is so glad he plays for England and not Australia.
I was there
"Ben stokes
Iss bnde ko koi nhi bhool skta
Aisa aisa match winning performance diya h ...koi believe nhi kr skta h"
The man who lifts the match in his shoulders = Ben stokes !!
Jack Leach's name will be carved in the history books. 🔥
I was watching this match with my brother and my father.... We all were astound ... Incredible
In this inning of Ben Stokes some of his shots are world class u have to give him credit irrespective of lbw
Every time im feeling crap and ive had enough of this covid i watch this say no more
The commentry of Marc Nicholas is something else! ❤
"if cricket is gentleman's game then every umpire decision should be checked, that will be more fair for both sides"
14:33 - WORST UMPIRE IN CRICKET HISTORY
Poor captaincy
Good game
Ben stroke great player.
And they say Test matches are boring. Most emotional and Supreme form of cricket. Long Live Test cricket..
"Buttler was very unlucky. Lyon broke the stumps with his hand without the ball. The bails were off before the ball hit the stumps. Lyon had to have known it. You can't not feel the ball hitting your leg while you break the stumps with your hand.

Australia and cheating, name a more iconic duo."
Greatest innings of all time #ben#
What a match. What a batting and greatest commentary of all time
One bad decision no review left
"Please subscribe :)

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjJYDVDhAS3sM5c_fzljJXg?view_as=subscriber"
"Ben stokes swung the bat to sweep so hard, it looked like it was going down the left side. Can't blame the umpire. The run out was such a miss but it was all nerves, Lyon must have regretted it"
"Full credit to England,Australia had their chances.
What an innings from Ben Stokes"
Won the match single handedly
"Best test match i have ever witnessed, stokes was outstanding. 
Love from india"
"Great cricket well played Stokes, worst captaincy by paine."
Useless captaicy from aus
I have never seen such a useless captain and player like Tim pain. if you Australia made George bailey as your captain Australia would not loose this match
Buttler dismissal was totally shambolic. The match could've end there. Both Buttller and stokes would vanish the score . But all hail Stokes he's the player of 2019.
Have seen this video many times. I just keep coming back for Lyon's last over.
17:07 - 17:13 - WOW!!!!
"Ben Stocks name is enough to complete One of Greatest All Rounder...........
He is modest All rounder today"
Most exciting thing I've ever watched. Leach did us proud
Couldn't have done it without Jack the Lad!
Aussies have met a talented and lucky BEN STOKES
Can someone please help me with the channel name this telecast is from? Here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrIew7-4isI - it's different!
Is mr.360 in the croud
What a mach was that
Wow
bad luck for the Aussies!
Only word Goosebumps ...
"I remember watching this live....the tension was epic....what a match, what a cricketer, what a summer of cricket"
For some reason I knew I had to watch the game and I remember sitting and watching it with my dad. This was an incredible innings by Stokes and I m privileged to have watched it live . Take a bow Ben Stokes u r a superman
"Before Archer's wicket went down..

Stokes to Archer: Let's build a parternship and win this match.

After Archer's wicket goes down
Stokes: Fine, I'll do it myself."
Aussies doesn't sleep on that night
Mark Nicholas “no way man”. Absolutely brilliant.
For me he is the best athlete on the earth.
One of the best
Hard luck Ben stokes
Pure joy
One man army show
One of the greatest Ashes match.
"I
Love 💕 Cricket but I hate football"
Umpires always favour England
Luck Favour the Brave BenStokes 👌👏👏🙌🍾Great match finish in test match cricket history.. I love Stokes... Love from India🇮🇳
Magnificent.... unbelievable... extraordinary.... sensational...
One M A N.   ARMY
Only one test match I will remember for ever.... Only test match Which gave me goosebumps all over my body..
Ben stokes all time favourite all-rounder
SUPER.............................NO WORDS
Hearing boundaries cheered like a goal in football. Incredible
Hats off to stokes effort but England didn't win this match because of umpire wrong defision... Its actually a Aussies win
Hero.
I am wondering if Australia made those last few mistakes in the end out of nervousness. It might have been disappointing for them.
A very close match. Exciting to watch.
Ben Stokes was out. Umpire gave the wrong decision. Overall Australia was unlucky. And there were a few mistakes in the fielding. The result could have been different.
Australia made so many mistakes as the innings was ending. They had a chance of winning. I laughed a couple of times. My heart was in my stomach.
Wonderful inning by benstocks
Aus lost two chances ..first that run out missed by Lyon ...it was so easy..second that lbw by Lyon which umpire rejected and that was out if review was there..the review they spoiled for leach could've been a match winner
17:00 what an epic shot this is
"When will we see these again?? That crowd, those shots, those nervy moments!!"
"What can anyone say,,other than unbelievable, heroic and will never be forgotten... thankyou ECB for showing this...now let's see the complete world cup final"
Well played stokes.your amazing player

"Apart from the usual ingredients that make up a classic for the ages, i.e a miraculous comeback and  heroics from the protagonist, this match had a splash of controversy and a dash of drama at the end...it’s actually not even fit to be a movie script as no one would believe that these events could actually happen on a cricket field! Simply Incredible!"
"Lot of people re-watching this in lockdown, same as me."
Real Winner AUS
I have been watching cricket since 1996 world cup and following the game very closely. It is best batting by any player in test cricket with so much pressure and ashes on the line..... 👍👌
Just put this on to check my new sound card worked .. 18:36 minutes later .. don't start it if you have anything important to do ...
Oohooo amazing man Ben stokes 😍😍😍😍
Tim Paine is the biggest joke.The review at 13:17 is blunder.Paine knows that it outside the  line but he took review just to utilise before ending the match  which made them cost at  14:36 which was  given out  and it was hitting stumps in the replay but no reviews left to challenge that decision .No one would challenge the  decision at 13:17 except Tim Paine.Cummins should have stopped him.......
Test cricket is best. Plenty of time to show your real talent with bat and ball. ❤️
One man army Ben stock
Just amazing!...
The greatest test match !!
"I was there that day, after we lost Broad the way the Aussies bowled at Stokes was criminal, don't get me wrong, I loved every second of it because they feared him."
Ben Stokes on Fire
Who said taste cricket is boring
Bad luck of Australias team and good luck of stokes strokes.....
Koi pochee to kehna STOKES AYA THAA...
Wonderful match ♥
"This why I love test cricket, Ben stokes perfect entertainer... I love to watch Ashes.."
He has retaliated against his insults.
Who else saw the last fall of Lyon at the end of clip😩
"Being there was crazy, the stadium was buzzing"
"Parera and Stokes both played the greatest 4th inning knock of the history in the same year. I enjoyed both.
P.S: Stokes certainly is a freak"
"Dont wait for Stokes retirement, confer him knighthood just now"
"Nathan lyon  give  the victory for england ,  miss the run out chance"
Unbliveable match❤❤
"This is the greatness of test cricket, every match is like a world cup final. I hope it stays alive."
"An amazing victory and full credit to Stokes and Leach, but the bowling was a gift. Where were the Yorkers? Almost everything was short of a length and dispatched to the boundary. Yes, a great result for England but Australia’s terrible bowling and captaincy helped a lot."
"Amazing batting, greatest test match innings i ever saw take a bow ben Stokes"
What a game !
"Lucky Ben stokes; Lucky English team, in WC19 and in this match as well"
"Whenever england wins man of the match should b umpires.
Ex:world cup final ,this test."
"you got to love England .....!  greetings from Sydney Australia, i actually wanted Stokes to won for England"
nice
"I've been watching cricket my whole life and this is the greatest test innings by an English player I can name. Watching it live, even from the other side of the world, was incredible. Stokes is a hell of a player."
"Missed the biggest thing that english cricketers celebration in dressing room.They should have recorded reaction of english players after every shot Ben Stokes played.
Any how one must agree Jack Leach scored a run of  million value."
Steven Smith not play for aus in this match that is the reason Eng win
"The real hero in the cricket history,Ben Stokes,,Love you from pakistan,,  I m the big fan of you Sir,,,,,,,"
"Great innings, proud fan moment @ 15.15"
One of the best innigs of  all time
17:06  😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
"Australia making mistake by taking last review 😥 for this reason they can't review on the wrong Decision of umpire of LBW & miss the runout.
But very good playing by Ben Stokes 💚❤"
Australia really needs Mitchell starc yorker who agree
What an incredible match 😮
I get chills every time
"Really Boss, Ben Stokes is a Match winning Player."
Unbelievable inning by Ben Stokes
That one mistake by lyon...
"73 runs to win with 1 wicket remaining.
Everyone :- That's Impossible.
Stokes:- No, It's necessary.
*No time for Caution (Interstellar) plays in background*"

Can't never get enough of this video and Ben Stokes' innings.
what a brilliant match
Ben Stokes Batting 👌👌👌👌👌
Leach Your A Hero
Useless umpire mistake..or else aus cud have win it
Ben stokes is my hero
Nasser Hussains commentary was better
fix
14:52 no review left for Australia
14:23 power of pressure
It's interesting to see ECB add current time in Graphics
Lost t20 world cup coz of ben Stokes and he cover up that in 2019 world cup and he is on the row still going on what a player
Joel wilson win the match  for england not ben stoke
is he gonna beat someone up?
"Ben Stokes had corrected all the mistakes he had done in the past won worldcup for England and Ashes.When he hits the ball, ball never cheats him."
Was Butler runout ?
Wow 😮
Why did i miss this match? Why😭😭😭😭💔
"Such a roller coaster of emotions that day..started off believing England just may be able to do it followed by weary resignation as we lost wickets in quick succession followed by 'we can't , surely?' and then the growing realisation that we might just. I could hardly watch the ending once England needed 15 or so as it seemed so near and yet so far yet Stokes held his nerve and the rest is history."
that was a better partnership than beckam and posh spice .
I can’t watch this it hurt at the beggining
It's commentary is change than other video
At 12.27 the fielder caught the ball then dropped it.
The missed run out at 14.01 tells you all you need to know. At 12.07 the fielder dropped an easy catch.
Man this was a fabulous effort
Jo jeeta woh sikandar
Lady luck just showered glitters on England in 2019! #Ashes19 #CWC19
17:00 minute was the great picture-perfect moment
Best inn
the best test match ever
14:34 england should thank joel wilson 😆😆
MATCH WINNING PARTNERSHIP (10TH WICKET) OF 76 RUNS BETWEEN BEN STOKES AND JACK LEACH. THIS HAD MADE THE DIFFERENCE
"14:00 When your friend brings a bad lunch to school 😄😄😄
Lesson learnt. The costliest mistakes are very trivial when they're made"
"Pure entertainment, classic cricket"
Even today Ben Stokes' innings gives me goosebumps!
One of the greatest test innings 😍
Cant forget this one of the great match in cricket history👌👌👌👌
One of the great test match I have ever seen. Love from India
"16:36...looks like the face of a man who put $100,000 on at $1.01 for Australia to win...and contemplating telling his wife"
Best mech is ben rock star ⭐❤😘 ben well done
"INCREDIBLE INNINGS OF BEN STOKES.
AN INNINGS TO BE REMEMBERED.
AN INNINGS TO BE ADMIRED.
BEN STOKES NO MATTER HOW MANY HUNDREDS TO SCORE IN YOUR CRICKET CAREER, THIS HUNDRED WILL REMAIN SPECIAL EVERLASTING FOR YOU.
OH MY GOD INCREDIBLE INNINGS.
I BECAME A FAN OF YOU AFTER WATCHING THIS INCREDIBLE INNINGS 135*(219). HIGH CLASS INNINGS BY A HIGH CLASS BATSMAN."
I saw this match on a live telecast...Nail-biting... What a match it is and what a player he is!!!!!
Benstoke is so lucky player
The culprit is Tim Paine for wasting a review
Fortune favours the brave.
Always Stokes hero
Ben Stokes batted like a man possessed.
"Incredible innings by ben Stokes❣️❣️👌✌️😊
& Thanks to English people for full attendence ❣️❣️"
Wha stocks
Great innings in cricket history
Stokes again lucky😂 but still if not won amazing innings
Wonderful test match
"And man of the match
Award goes to Mr jack leech"
2 catch miss and bad umpire decision so England win this match.. Catch miss match miss....
शानदार
I was by the side of aus but was supporting Ben stokes.....
"Time passed...people got modernise...
But test cricket didn't change even an inch...
And Ashes is glittering in its old colour also...."
Ben Stokes #nailed it
"Tim Paine decision to take review was pathetic...
otherwise the result would be different..."
Best all rounder in England
Kusal perera is great batsmon 😘
Nathan leyon has chance of very easy runout but can't do..and umpire didn't give lbw by Nathan Lyon bowling..it clear out and Australia haven't review left...its coincidence..Great inning of Ben stokes..
Ben stokes love 💕
Generally we see this kind of situations in t20 formats.. But for the first time in test cricket I saw the unbelievable run chase.... Huge round of applause to last wicket partnership..
Ben stokes heroics win in headingley 🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏
"13:20 unnecessary review from Paine,
13:55 Then runout miss,
14:34 Stokes trapped in front (no reviews left),
15:00 Leach grabs a single,
15:21 Stokes finishes off."
The greatest test match i have seen ever
1:56 england can lose but🙄
कोहली के 7 जन्म लग जाये फिर भी ऐसा मैच वो कभी जीता नही सकता।
Whattttt a player stoke is and whattttt a matchhhhhh
Ben stokes is a hero❣️
Right time right execution is always important ...
Tim Paine looked like sheep for asking the review
"Lyon, Marcus Harris looked like fool"
Umpire you beauty😁😁😁
Nathan Lyon run out chance cost a lot...
is match ko dekhkr lga ki test match m b fixing hoti h so sad 😶
"Greatest inning,.... most valuable player.... fighter....top rated all rounder.,. Bought in IPL -15.50 crores"
Great effort from stokes and leach... With luck
"All forms of cricket need co come to an end for the year. Just like FIFA soccer, Formula1, ATP, WTA, NBA< NFL, NHL, IOC, just name it? How unair is it to all the other sportsmen in humanity who have sacrificed their lives to stop the health care crisis?


Meanwhile, the mens and womens tour needs to be merged to save millions of pounds. Improve administration so when sport reopens, it will reopen with a bang generating huge revenues.


This could bring back all the losses all boards lost in the financial markets. Without finance, interest in the game can wane. Besides it will simplify admin re: mens and womens's contracts. Women might get better sponsorship. T20, ODI's, Tests will all come under 1 umbrella.


Men earn multiple times over women. This will bring equality. It will also expedite the women coming on par with men.


First journalists need to top glorifying cricket.
 Next, CA needs to cancel all cricketing events for 2020. 
Finally, social media must cut off cricket news, so that the concentration will be on kids catching up with academics, business restoring economies and cricket contributing to restoring human life rather than pursue selfish interests. 
Million of lives are on the line."
Cricket is boring without English crowd
I need 2013 champion trophy final highlights ind vs eng plzz
it's going to be gutting not having things like this to watch in the summer. this was genuinely one of the greatest moments of sport i have ever had the privilege to watch live
One and only Ben stokes can finish this type of match...probably we won't see this type of match again
11:35 super shot and good timing....
Umpire cheated at the last time lbw
"One catch missed, one runtout missed and one wrong decision by umpire makes England win.."
That last capture of Stokes hitting the winning run with the crowd rising like never seen before. No matter how many times I see this I get goosebumps
"Blessed to watch this live on tv.
Thankyou ben stokes for what you have done to england cricket.
Love from 🇵🇰"
"17:06 😍😍😍
Very best moment"
Goospumbs
I think real hero was jack leach😂
"Stock unbelievable inining, I have ever seen"
The greatest knock played by a nightwatchman is 1 n.o. By jack leach
We are England
"Extraordinary match...,,"
The greatest 1 run of all time in test cricket!!!
There were a lot of moments which stopped my heartbeat for a sec.
This still gives me goosebumps No doubt this was one of the best Test matches ever happened in history of cricket.
Yes Stokes was exceptional but Jack Leach's contribution was so so crucial it can't be underlooked.
After Tony Greg & Bill Lawry... It's time of Mark Nicholas
🇮🇳🇬🇪
England cricket love from india🥰🥰🇮🇳
കുറെ കാലമായി കാത്തിരുന്ന ലോങ്ങ്‌ വീഡിയോ

Wow amazing ❤ ben stokes remember this name

He is the greatest cricket ever in England cricket history
MN on commentary is legendary!
"Stokes you are my hero ,my role model .👍👍🙏"
17:00 aesthetic every cricketer dream for this kinda celebration. When I roar the crowd roars too.
This is one to TELL  about your grandchildren. What a days cricket! Stokes days

"I think of the person who gave dislike to this video....
No matters what whether you are Australian or England's .. It is the greatest innings in cricket history ... Ever... Ever played.
Hats off , love and respect to Benjamin 
 Stokes."
Legend says that half of english and aussies ended up in Hospital emergencies during this test..
But stokes was out in that lbw of lion
Unable to understand that why umpire didn’t give out (watch at 14:49)
Every single time i open YouTube i straight ahead go for this run chase video. What an tremendous chase by this young man. And moreover now a day he's become my fav batsman. This video make my day every single time. Thanks to this channel
Real hero is umpire who gives stokes not out at last.wrong decision cost ashes
Beauty...ben strokes is always my fav batsmen....
I have no word for explain my feeling... mindbloing inning by stokes
आज तक मेने ऐसा टेस्ट मैच नहीं देखा 😄
Luckyman
One of the incredible inning of Ben Stokes.  Lyon dropped Ashes
When K I N G  S T R O K E S
I'll say it straight up: I'm an Aussie. THAT was one of the best innings I have ever seen. I remember staying up to watch it. Unbelievable. I'm fired up watching it again.
"2009: monty panesar
2019: Leach"
Magnificent well played Leech
"Whats great about Ben Stokes is, he doesn't lift his bat at the half-century mark or at the century mark. He's probably thinking job's not done yet.

Pulls England through to the victory in an almost-impossible to win match and then.... Lifts his bat. Job's DONE!

What a batsman?!?! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻"
Treat to watch 👏
That crowd!
Nothing went Aussie way.. . In those lost 100 runs.. . One of the best test match
"The Greatest test match of all time 

Ben Stokes' incrideble"
Ben Stokes superhuman you beauty
Geoff Boycott should have been the commentator at the end with the female. We would have heard some interesting phrases and exclamations!
What a back ground sound 😳😳❤️❤️
Amazing batting by Ben Stokes. Comes really close to being the greatest innings in a test. I think Kusal Janith Perera's 153* against SA in SA is the GREATEST test innings in the history. Can't believe these 2 innings amazing innings were just 2 months apart.
"Leach The Champion.
1 Run
17 Balls
1 Review. 

Please show the highlights of all 17 balls played by Leach."
Only time I heard and saw English crowd like Indians.
I've seen Aussie bowlers that have made English batsmen scream in frustration. Stokes avenged them all.
"इंग्लैंड world cup me bhi yese hi jita tha hara huva,,, लेकिन har गई है ye"
When the fate wants you to win..
"I didn't like that woman commentating and ofcourse that other man.
Let Nicholas, Vaughn and great Jeffery commentate more, su*kers!"
Aussies deserved to win...fool umpire
Lara's 153 and Stokes' 135 must be the two of the Greatest innings to win a test. England's talisman always

Amazing match I ever seen like this excellent👍👏😆
So many close sixes. Got to love that new boundry rule.
aus had more than a moment
Want critics to say test cricket is on d verge of losing popularity after watching dis match
This match is designed in such a way that England will not loose the match even if they wanted to lose. The design can be called as FATE.....
That's why I like team England team next to india😎🏏
Jack leach u beauty!!
Ben Stokes! ❤️
Not reviewing win.
Chuke doud leach..chuke doud...sabaash...

"What a beauty . well played stokes , lion run out and last umpire decision 😂 🙈"
lion was the paramount of that match and stoke was TITANS of that match.
Ben stokes is England kapildev
WC innings gives him confidence that he can do it....
Serapana seigai ....petta movie villa dioluge
"Greatest test match of all time
Greatest test innings of all time
I hated England for the way they won the world cup but this was actually crazy. Mad Respect"
"Ben you beauty...Awesome match
one man Army"
Great man
"One word can define him ""Alone Warrior."""
As a Japanese Cricket fan my favorite team is *Hindu-India* but Ben Strokes is best all-rounder except for that T20 world cup final against WI.
England and Ben stokes was very lucky
Real cricket
"When God is with Ben Stokes nothing can stop him to win, This test match and World Cup Final, my God...History will never forget !🤩"
Ben stokes scores 50 no celebration scores 100 no celebration and here comes mushfiquer rahim. 😂😂

"Fixed.....

Brave inngs from Ben Stokes and Supportive inngs from Leach
"Unbelievable victory by English Team and Ben Stokes 
  Congratulations from Pakistan"
"Being a true cricket lover, I admire the English team revolution. They are a treat to watch.  And Ben you are the best😍💪. Love from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳"
"Stokes is playing really very good knock but when 2 runs remaining he was surely out but AUS don't have any review 😟😟
Aciedently won the match like he won the world cup"
Bad luck of Australia team
Mark Nicholas is the Peter Drury of cricket. Voice and words could make any boring match interesting.
"Ben stokes a perfect example for one of the best comebacks.
2016 T20 worldcup to this ashes and the worldcup 2019.
Amazing ben stokes."
Its like scripted
Best moment 17:06 ❤️🔥
The audience makes this video more special..
"The all time best test and odi innings award goes to Ben Stokes, this test innings and the ODI 2019 WC final against NZ."
Its really hard for batsmen to impress an Indian fan but let me tell you this  one by Ben stokes is absolutely jaw dropping performance .what a player and what a match . Single handedly  took England to victory . This innings will be remember for a long time .Ben stokes is a freak .
SIR BENJAMIN STOKES...!!!!
what inning by Ben.................True Master
"Listened to this in a bar in Brazil on the TMS youtube channel (it is a thing, but only outside the uk and aus). Thanks Ben. Hell of a moment. Happy memories. Felt so close to home that day. And thanks TMS. Worth protecting the beeb for on its own"
One of the Best innings played by stokes
"Wt an incredible and remarkable match.., just it happened sometimes.... Stokes stays in England cricket lovers heart forever as a super hero"
17:01 - 17:13 that sums up it all.
"Ben stokes most important part of the best test match ever played
Best odi ever played
Best t20i ever played (but on wrong side)"
There's change in the commentry. That is not the commentry we've listened on live tv.🤔🤔. No Michael holding no Nasser Hussain no Michael antherton no Shane warn no Ricky pointing.
This is a best inng in last ten year in cricket history
My pe just wants me to watch this for my lesson easy
Ben stokes 😎😎😎😎♥️♥️
2 nd biggest cheat after world Cup in English grounds
The review they missed in 3rd last over
Sabse badi galti jb review galat time pe liya jb lena chahiye tb bacha nhi review
Man of the match- Umpires
Australian is responsible for there loss.bad decision to take the last review..Ben stokes awesome 💯. Sab that butler runout without scoring run..but victory is victory.. doesn't matter how it comes
The gay commentator is very annoying
It was a fixed match definitely
Only luck for England but great finish ben stokes
"Reason of Australia's loss is that Umpire gave that lbw not out.
Umpire should have give out at that time and then England could take last review for last wicket. Clearly umpire  wanted England to win."
Cheating aussies burning their last review was priceless.
Love Headingley. Such a better atmosphere than Lords.
well played Ben stokes but man of the match should be Nathan Lyon
Why TF does Broad doesn't accept that he can get out.. jeez the guy's like a backyard cricket cry baby.. waiting for the day when he'll get bowled and still take the DRS.. And none of us will be surprised if it happens @ 8:44
Along with Ben stokes credit goes to the umpire as well.
Why werent moeen ali an adil rashid in the eng ashes squad?
In todays troubles always have a daily dose of Stokes. Even the Aussies will smile!
What a player ben stokes
one of the best test match innings i ever seen
jesus gave aussies 4 chances to win nail bitter.....but they loose it. Bad luck australia
"Watching the Butler stumping in slow motion, and the wicket-keeper didn't have the ball in his hands."
What a human error..
Umpair won the match for england😣😏😤
Stoks  ashol  criketer hero
Match Fix
Iconic innings🔥
Lucky England.. Australia should have won...
"What a match man... Wow...
Bad luck for Australia catches dropped review taken at wrong time and that  run out 
But it was stokes day and he tooked his day  wow amazing match"
Big ben fire
"meanwhile was reciting his name :D 
ben**** :*"
One man show Ben stokes. ...👏👏👏👏
"Australia blew the game so hard!! Stupid review for the one pitching outside leg, Lyon fumbles the ball to win it and if they had a review, Stokes would've been LBW... Australia had it and they let it slip big time!! Come on lads"
14:04 everybody was on the knee lol! first time to see australia reeling at this stage !
Biggest and best innings ever!
That umpire was bought by England cricket board
"I couldn't watch this so I had Test Match Special on with Aggers, Glenn McGrath and Alistair Cook. Incredible piece of radio commentary on an incredible match."
few mistakes by Aussies taking review on wrong time and fail to run out leach  but credit goes to stokes because fortune favours the brave
Stokes . Is my idol...
The best test match in history
Poor captaincy Tim Paine
Stokes we never forget you...
17:00 there is no better cricketing moment than this. The batsman knowing he has secured the match moments before the crowd. What a shot!
Greatest of all innings
Super ben stokes
"https://youtu.be/X71fcluZ9H4
give it a watch guys!"
Nathon lyon drops it🤦‍♂
Bad umpiring at crunch moment
I saw this match live ohhhhh my god what a match that was❤😃
God gave 2 chances in last Lyon over .. foolish captain ..it's clearly outside leg ball ..he asked drs .and wasted .. on the other hand stokes played brilliant game ..
That's Why I Always Like Test Matches More Than ODI's Or T20. I Don't Support Any Nation. I Just Love Good Cricket.
"Don't know what umpiring performance was worse, this game or the WC Final."
Finally with great commentators voice  uploaded. Thank
"Commentator: Australia closing on to the victory 
Benjamin Stokes: oh wait! Hold my beer"
Best chase ever
Hi
"""The ashes well and truly alive because of one cricketer and that is benjamin stokes""

""Up in the air again
Western terrace again 
Six again""
Nasir hussain👌"
Test match at its best....
it is benstokes who won the match not england
"8:14 Root ka, Bairstow ka, Buttler ka, Woakes ka, Archer ka, sabka badla lega ye Ben Stokes"
❤️😂😂😷
Leach lived up to his name..he STUCK to Ben Stokes to win the game!
its looking like fixed match
"Two drop catches , a runout chance missed and a wrong decision as well…  commentator said the greatest innings ever played… wtf…  just lucky"
Incredible Stokes..Stokes is my fav .. forever ❤️❤️👌👌👌👌👌👌👌🏏🏏🏏🏏
O my god  kohli   soch  key  dar jaaayegaa
Everyone is here just to see jack leach score that 1 run and stokes to absolutely boss the game😂😂
Greatest match ever
16:09 a true example of great leadership. Smile even in defeat
best test cricket match ever
Perhaps this will be the greatest match our generation will be seeing
16:36 I laughed at this supporter the first time I saw the match. But rewatching these highlights broke my heart for the sad dude. That's the beauty of this game providing unspeakable happiness on one day while agony on another.
LBW??
Stokes is the worlds best alrounder ever
"Unbelievable Moments Lyons can remove leach but Bad luck of Kangaroos and Ben stoke is good All-rounder and he know can you play under pressure moments Responsible Batsman and All-rounder Ben Stoke  
Well Played Ben Stokes
#Well Played Australia
#CongrulationEngland
✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️"
"There is only one legend 

Carlos Braithwaite - Remember the Name"
No one can win from destiny
Stokes is super man
Undoubtedly the best innings i have ever watched! Some special breed of cricketer this guy Stokes is. Very much like the great Ian Botham and Freddie Flintoff!  The jubilation of stokes after cracking that 4 and the crowd jumping in the background very much sums up the beauty of test match cricket! Cricket at its very best!
"A great display from Stokes and the most invaluable run anybody can ever score by Leach. But it's also an example of what pressure does to you. First Australia lost its review in a desperate attempt to salvage when everybody and their mother knew that it was not out, and then the ball slipped through Lyon's fingers for what could have been one of the easiest run-outs."
"""Ben stokes You beauty""..✔️"
Great batting it was... Who watched it live hit like
True warrior
"greatest match i ever seen,and of 21st century"
Nathan Lyon villain for Australia 😂😂
The all time best test match of history ❤️❤️❤️
Puse at 17:14 for one of the most iconic stills
Memorable 1* ever.
The LBW was plum in front
That New Zealander is good at batting
"Australia was robbed, but it was still an innings to remember."
"And some fools are comparing hardik pandya with Stokes. Rolf. Hardik is a kid at international level , just at IPL."
He is TRULY incredible!!!!
Biggest cheater
Pakistan - I was shocked to watch this incredible match - Stokes Strikes Strong
"Pure luck, WC too."
What a hero Ben Stokes is ! He will certainly be the best cricketer of next decade . Sheer talent .. He deserves to be skipper of England Side instead of Joe Root .
Fantastic ♥️🏏
He’s dropped the ashes 😂🤣
Umpires won't the ashes !!
I can say History will remember Ben strokes forever🔥
Chitting
One of the Best Test Match I've ever seen in 2019 ❤️🔥
"Completely honoured to have witnessed that in person. What a day, what a memory. 
Sporting history 👏"
when the match is not in your destiny then the more you try you cant win it
"GREATEST TEST MATCHES of all time
1)Headingley test 1981 ENG vs AUS
2)Barbados test 1998 WI vs AUS
3)Kolkata test 2001 IND vs AUS
4)Birmingham test 2005 AUS vs ENG
5)Leeds test 2014 SL vs ENG 
6)Headingley test 2019 AUS vs ENG"
Great fighter
Inning of decade Ben stokes you Beauty
Did Butler was out at 5:36 ...?
"Ben is not a human, 
He is a superhuman"
"He was lucky 2 drop catches 1 stumping missed ,1 lbw not given !!! But luck favours the brave !!! Best test match that i have seen live !!!"
U watch kusal perera inings betar than this inings 🇱🇰
Kiwis is best
Please give fourth test in ashes
Nathan lyon dropped a golden chance
Did any one realise that crowd actually cheering instead of clapping !!!!
"This was the only way England would have won this match,they simply cant play test cricket.Worst ambassadors of test cricket.Dont believe me watch stokes's innings in the next test ! This match was tailor made for stokes. Worst match i have ever seen"
"You know what, i just watched this video for nearly 5 times per day in amid lockdown# what a player Benjamin stokes# what a test wowza"
ive seen this over 20 times and i still get mad goosebumps
I hope I can erase the memory of this test just so I can watch it agin and again and feel the nerves.....omg....this was one of the best sports experiences of my life...it won't get better than this....I was jumping out of my couch and my mom and aunt were looking at me like I have gone crazy.
Atmosphere was INSANE! Best you'll ever hear at a cricket match.
"WOW, WOW, WOW!! My favourite moment, BEN Stokes 100 & not celebrating, jobs not done yet. Greatest Innings of all times!! England cricket at its best, Amazing by B Stokes."
"This is what makes Lyon the greatest. Despite the fumble, he was able to trap THE MAN in the very next ball. Only for the umpire to make yet another blunder.."
"Warner dropped,Harris dropped,leon missed run out,lost review,Stocks LBW but no review.. total dramatic test..all credit goes to luck 😎"
080000016
Layon is fixer in runout chance
They are nothing they are just morons on the name of cricket they dont deserve anything if they were honest especially ben he would have leave the pavillion when he was lbw on lyons ball
Ben was lbw on lyons ball but umpire didnt give it
England are cheaters they won the wcup by cheating and also this test by cheating
"every time stokes hit a shot:
crowd be like:
yaaaaaaaaah...YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH"
Luck !!!
Greatest knock of all time.. hats off to this freak
"Ben Stokes was exceptional, one of the top all time innings.. but watching these highlights a year later makes me realise that Australia really choked here: the dropped catch, terrible final review and Lyon's missed runout.. With the series win theirs for the taking they really bottled it."
This is the best and most thrilling test match I ve seen after the test of laxman ojha partnership vs australia in Mohali.
ben stokes is a freak of nature. will go down as easily one of the greatest all-rounders of the game.
"What about LBW not given.....by umpire!
But still best inning by Ben stokes"
Benjamin Andrew Super stokes
Nice LBW decision rofl. Fixed match
Jack leach is the makaya ntini of test match..like of you understand
Lbw decetion rong this is match umpiring side England
I watch it live.memorable match
Ayooo enna adi....stokesyy illa na eng mukkiyamaana ellam match me thothrukum... A best all rounder in cricket in the universe😍😍😎😘😘there is no player like this in Indian team... stokesyy it was stroking😊😊😊
One word. Hollywood! Amazing!!!
It's a great match but don't forget 2005 ashes
Waited years to have an Ian botham style of Freddie flintoff cricket MR Benjamin stokes. His crixking style also reminded the same way southafrican LANCE KLUSENER played in his early years. Would like to have such fund raising match for CORONA PANDEMIC after the PANDEMIC ends...
"First it crafted Andrew Flintoff, and now the Ben Stokes. English soil isn't less fertile for great cricketers."
Ben Stokes a Man with Golden Luck Element + Nerves
Shoes off
I am proud  of  you  stokes
This commentary is better than naseer hussain commentary..BEN STOKES IS NEW DAD OF ALL CRICKETERS...LOVE FRM INDIA
dislikes come from down under perchance?
what a player...modern day Flintoff....amazing to watch.
Stokes Under pressure = God Mode enabled
Something special for all cricket lovers like me...the scene at 17:10..wow..... increadible...
How can someone not hate the English!?
Loved it❤❤❤
Greatest test match nd greatest odi match in the same year 2019
"Tim paine made foolish decision to take last review.......
😀😁😁 Kangaroos loses"
"Though there had been a little bit bad umpiring and bad fielding, howbeit Ben Stokes was hero of that match for winning it  to his nation. He is not only effective all-rounder but also a player who is blessed by god. Whatever   team he is in! I believe victory will go to him."
That switch hit six was something great
This is a different commentary .i heard nasser and atherton I think
"I almost forgot what was the last great match I had seen..Yeah, this match..Thanks, ECB for uploading this in this tough time of the lockdown. Test Cricket is the best cricket."
15:23 Incredible crowd roar!.  The British crowds are the best.
Ben...what a player
Such a extraordinary Innings all time❤❤🐰
Aus lose because they had missed last run out when Eng need 2 runs
This illustrates perfectly why sport can be so perfect. It also illustrates why test cricket is the unrivalled king of sports.
The greatest shot of all time in cricket history
Watch at 9:50 it will make your day
What man this Ben Stokes
Test match of the year. 2019
"How can you dislike this video, the greatest game for the great game, what a summer 2019 was and sadly we might not get anything in 2020."
"Can anyone tell me 
Why this you tube channel always Upload  
channel 5's ashes highlights package 
Why not Sky sports highlights package"
ben stokes is the hero? no. The REAL hero here is Jack Leach. His 1 not out was one of the most magnificent innings ever!
Lol!! Pakistani and indians have seen such things in Lagaan movie....But at that time I didn't know it do happens in reality
The turning point was actually the new ball spell by the Aussies. They didnt bowl the ball in the right areas and allowed Ben Stokes to get going. Ben Stokes was 2 off 70 overnight. Considering they were so good throught the series upto that point.
Wow Super stoks
That commentary at the end of mark Nicholas reminds me of Ea sports cricket 07😍😍😍
"I was in an airport in Cuba watching the highlights of the day, myself, my brothers and my dad huddled around my phone and when stokes hit those winning runs we celebrated like we scored them ourselves. Love cricket ❤️🏏"
"What an innings he is one of the great players to play the game, he can bat he can bowl he is just the complete all rounder take a bow jack leach"
For some reason you can't see the ball clearly
Still i m shivering to watch this highlights being an ENGLISH supporter
I wished I can erase my memory & watch this again without knowing the result. The tension is real
I dont know why its trending in Pakistan!
How this video on trending...
omg
Ben stokes is on fire in this match
ECB has restricted indi^an mo%fos from viewing some of their videos 😍😍 yahoooo #pes^ts to the whole world
"Winning Moments like this dhoni and kohli gave alot to india so i can totally understand how England must have felt , such a great inning, truly shows how good of a player he is. Next big thing"
Tim Paine's DRS on Jack Leach which was missing leg stump cost the match for the Englishmen otherwise they could have reviewed it for Ben Stokes when they required 2 runs actually the wickets hitting
Butler was not out
Please upload only stokes Innings
"It was a hot, hot day.  So I went out for a drive in the car so I could stick the air conditioning on and cool down.  Put the Test Match on to pass the time.


Ended up being out for 3 hours as each time Stokes hit another run, I'd drive a bit further so I could keep listening.  I ended up hearing the winning runs driving up a winding road in the marshes and had to pull over, so wrought with emotion that I was a danger to other road users...


It took me the best part of an hour to get back afterwards."
Missing Naseer Hussain commentary.. it would have made this video more enjoyable. #EnglandCricket
Makes me so happy whenever I watch this
🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
"""Its too much for everybody as simpe as that"" 13:55"
"Extraordinary Batting By Stokes.

 Poor Captaincy By Paine., Even though they know it's pitching outside leg and they gone for review.
If that review is remain it would be Aussies Game."
This match is very interesting.
One of the best games
Just want to say Thank You to England Cricket.
"No doubt about it, that decision not to give Stokes LBW was one of the worst umpiring decisions you will see. Not only because it was flush, but also England had a review left which they were always going to use. However, the ball before was one of the easiest run outs you will see. And Aus wasted a review on one which was missing by miles."
"As the typical Englishman says


You lucky bastard"
"Mark Nicholas calls the game  the way  only he can  saw it with sky commentary, seen  it first  time  with channel 4 sadly it was the last time on four because BBC Sports  took up the cricket, sky sports should include  Mark Nicholas in thier panel  because  their  team  is to one  dimensional and  he is the best ❤❤"
9:50 shows the confidence of Ben stokes 💪💪
17:05 what an incredible moment.
Still umpire did the big mistake..DRS must be increase by 6
Hey sir! Hope you are doing well!! you are my mentor and you inspired me a lot so that I started my own YouTube channel few days before please help me to grow my subscribers it should be a great favour.. click on the link👉 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh9U4rjkCcuaEbXviZxVUAA
England was lucky
"As an Aussie, traveling alone, I couldn't have asked for a better game of Ashes cricket to witness. Went Day 3 and stayed for Day 4, despite having originally booked a flight for Spain. 
The tension, drama, skill and courage on display...Easily the greatest game of cricket I have seen!"
"Still lost the Ashes,Sir Steve Smith the one man army was enough for these fake world champions,a world cup which they never won,England were lucky too,drop catches and a run out bottled by Lyon at the end,no hate for stokes brilliant innings though"
will never get over this match!!!!!!
Please give 4th test at old Trafford
Foolishness by the Aussies to take a wasteful review.
"Well if he is not the best all rounder in the world right now show me who is..
This guy can go to the heights of Kallis and above"
"14:14 Commentetor Has He Drop.The Ashes...
Lion... yes I Does😅😅😅
17:10 Look The Crowd Look At The Seen Oh My Gosh😘😘"
"Tom Banton top sixes 👇
https://youtu.be/frgFeOsWN7s

Kindly watch the video & subscribe the channel"
Still want to know how much ENG paid the umpire in the end not to give him LBW. Stokes was plum of Nathon Lyon. Australia had no reviews and England had a review left. So England could of contested the decision. Cheating at its highest level. ECB old men have a lot of money to throw around behind the scenes
The most important contribution in this run chase is Jack Leach's 1 run
My team england
"Thank you for posting, perfect to relive this during COVID-19."
NO MATTER HOW MANY VIDEOS YOU POST ABOUT THIS MATCH . THE ASHES IS IN AUSTRALIA
All time best Test inning✌👌😊
"who thinks england allarounders
Flintoff-Bowling for victory
Stokes batting for victory.
 last 46 runs pure gold just ben stokes hitting sixes like t20 match
first time series firey commentator"
"Come on guys show the whole match ball for ball or the entire ashes, we all staying home doing as we're told, give us something to watch. you get the views and money and we get entertained, you surely own or have the viewing rights to show it yes..?"
One of the greatest innings of all time
Ben 💪🏼💪🏼🔥🔥
Bean stokes is best
The nan who gave 4 gave 4 sixes to Carlos braitwaite won wc 2019 and this innings whoch England could remember forever...
Can we have a full replay of day 5 of the 4th test please?
Stokes is at his best with leach
Ben Stokes is a hero.
"Watched this game live, and have re-watched this moment time after time since. Still gives me goosebumps - will never forget that innings by Stokes and how is was able to captivate a nation, and capture everyone’s collective imagination. Test Cricket at its very best!"
Strokes is just luck
Fortune favours the brave
One of the best test matches I have ever seen
I remember 1981. They've got to be on a par. Followed it in Spain on BBC cricket on my phone. Nearly finished this old man.
ECB U know what i m missing nasser hussain comentrey
test cricket is the best from all three formats
I am gonna change my religion to follow whatever god Ben Stokes worships.
Great innings 👌
"Australia lost the test, too many chances lost"
"What a match? My favourite all rounder only ben stocks
And shahid afridi"
It is through this matches we can say cricket is reviving
Who watch the full video?🤔🤔
Why only 18 minutes ?????
Greatest EVER. 🏏❤❤❤❤🇫🇴
Missing Naseer Hossain in Commentary.
"That's wht test cricket means to cricket lovers. .... Best format of cricket...
Cricket is a game of uncertainty.... 👍"
Nathan Lyon...What a beauty!
damn i miss cricket...plz back
GREATEST TEST MATCH EVER SEEN 🙌❤️💜
Is this test match or t20 match what a crowd
I understood that you will show full day highlight (ball by ball)
That balls blocked by jack leach & that tie run england win 😎
wow
"I didn't believe that we could win it, but my dad insisted to not give up hope. That was the only time I was happy to be proven wrong. What an innings."
My favourite test of all time. Thanks to airtel4g i show this live😂😂
What a innings stokes...I'm seeing 50 th time
"One of my proudest 'I was there' moments, except that I was on the sofa watching the Sky Sports coverage. The entire last wicket partnership was a highlight."
"11:10 My favourite moment - Stokes taking 4, 6, 6, 2, 1 off Josh Hazlewood, and then Leach defending the last ball.
14:50 For some reason, I remember the Sky Sports ball-tracking graphic being less conclusive, but I'm still convinced the ball clipped his front pad and was drifting down leg.
15:18 Do you believe in miracles?
It's still a thrill to watch later. T'moral of t'story - it in't over 'til it's over."
"Ben stokes like afridi he won  match against there hard opponent 
Remember asia cup 2014 pak vs india 
              😘BOOM BOOM 😘
                      😘 AFRIDI😘"
Missed run out ( Nathan lyon) & LBW not given?? And people still believe cricket is not scripted like WWE. They will always be fooled by these actors. I placed 10k and won 2 lakh on england. Have friends playing IPL. People are blind totally crap who think this is real. Haha
Stupid are people who compares Stokes with Hardik. Hardik is not 10% of Stokes. He is only a showoff player and good player in IPL fixing matches.
The match was fixed!
How does Joel Wilson have a job
Sheer Europa
"May not have been a series where excellence was common. But, where there was excellence it was historic."
This is One of the best test match I have watched till date . Well done Ben .incredible
"when 9th wicket was down, I turned off the tv. a few hours later I saw England win by 1 wicket and I was sad I missed possibly the greatest innings in a cricket match"
"England won the WC2019 on cheating.
And umpires help to win the ashes last test...
England is cheater."
Wowwwwww
Wow amazing
The test documentary is such a great documentary a must watch
"Test Matches like these, makes me a proud cricket lover . Ben is best allrounder of current cricket era"
One of the best test match
Greatest innings ever. Ben stokes u legend!
Ben stoks your beaty
We thought they can't produce another Flintoff. They produced even better...
This greatest knock by Ben Stokes remains forever in my heart.... #Ashes series is best in World cricket #
Test Cricket at its very best. I rate this English victory even above the famous 2005 Edgbaston win. Benjamin Stokes. You absolute beauty!!!!
"Imagine if pak & ind play annually
What great moments heroes we get.."
Stokes is a truly remarkable talent
After Kolkata Test match this is the best match I have seen
What an atmosphere. Ashes is truly the soul of cricket
Great upload!
Something about this ground innit
"I watched this live at our local town cricket pavilion and there was about 100 people all going mental, great scenes"
Only stoke can control this game
Nasir hussain's commentery is another level💥
Amazing
"I don't think that it's a grate 100.
Bcoz it's not a challenge condition.
I think Steve Smith 109 Against India 2017 this was the grate 100 of all time. 
Bcoz Pune Maharashtra cricket stadium pitch was so much challenging and Steve Smith show his class Against nasty and powerful Indian pace and spin attack.
Also remember the home and away conditions."
goosebumps. this is test cricket!
What A Match 🥰
"The Greatest test match of all time?
Like-Yes
Comment - No"
It just gets more incredible with each viewing...
One of the greatest moment i have gone through in my life...Hats off my stoksy!!
"I freely admit that when he hit those winning runs, i cried like a baby for a whole 10 minutes."
Same luck England wc 2019 and ashes
"Well england are fixing I think 
In the final the trash rules my umpire probably fixed 

Now probably fixed too"
Mark Nicholas's voice is poetic ❤
I want to see full from 8 wicket down this day . Please ECB I'm ur one of the longest viewer
"Ew, the Channel 5 rubbish 🙄"
Salute for Ben stokes
🔥💪🏻💪🏻❤
i dont know what  bad deeds i did that i watched the entire ashes but skipped this day due to some work and then my mobile battery went off  i am not forgiving myself any sooner :X
I thought the day will be uploaded ball by ball😢😢
Ben stokes u rock🙏
I h8 ben stokes.....
"That review lost the match for Australia

https://youtu.be/7XUPhKjEpeY
Stock best batsman all format

Thank you so much ECB for this. Won't be forgotten
Boss's My Stokes
Waiting... 👀
Is this ball by ball?
Please.. can you premiere Australia 60 all out match.. The 4th Ashes Test 2015 @ Trent Bridge
"Watched this last night again it really was an amazing test, want to watch every ball, highlights doesn't do it justice imo, the tension isn't the same, need every ball, oh and turn off the god awful chats, so many idiots commenting like trolls or children or something..?"
I keep thinking that the 2019 Ashes won't be remembered for the result because it was a drawn series with Australia winning by virtue of being the holders. What will be remembered is Ben Stokes' heroics to win the Headingley Test!😀😁😃😄🏏
🤩
Please upload 2014 ind vs eng test series
When can we watch the entire ashes series from day one test one to the end..? I would love to watch the entire ashes again..
